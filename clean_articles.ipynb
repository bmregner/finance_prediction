The stock added about 1.4 percent in price since last results when it was at $127.17 a share. Based on the most relevant past-periods data, there is an 58.82 percent probability for this firm’s share price to go up following next quarterly results. Earnings reaction history tells us that the equity price moved up 10 times out of last 17 reported quarters.

The stock climbed 1.35% the day following the earnings announcement, and on 7th day price change was -0.67%.\\n\\nOn April 27, 2016, it recorded $0.57 a share in earnings which topped the consensus estimate of $0.44 (positive surprise of 29.55%). Revenue for the quarter was $5.38B while analysts called for revenues to be $5.26B. The stock gained 7.2% the day following the earnings data was made public, and on 7th day price change was 8.42%.\\n\\nOn January 27, 2016, it announced earnings per share at $0.59 versus the consensus estimate of $0.5 per share (positive surprise of 18%). That came on revenues of $5.84B for that period. Analysts had expected $5.37B in revenue.\\n\\nAs Q4 earnings announcement date approaches, Wall Street is expecting earnings per share of $1.07. The analysts’ present consensus range is $0.89-$1.3 for EPS. The market consensus range for revenue is between $7.19B and $7.84B, with an average of $7.62B.\\n\\nFacebook, Inc.
