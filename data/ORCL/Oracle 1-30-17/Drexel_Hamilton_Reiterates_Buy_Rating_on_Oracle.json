{"body": "In a report released Jan. 18, Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White reiterated a Buy rating on Oracle Corp. (ORCL) and set a price target of $47.00. That figure represents potential upside of 19.93 percent from Wednesday’s closing price of $39.19.\n\nAccording to TipRanks.com, White is a five-star analyst with an average return of 58.1 percent success rate and an average return of 8.2 percent.\n\nWhite's bullish report came a day after the company hosted its Oracle CloudWorld event in New York. During the event, Oracle co-CEO Mark Hurd detailed how his firm has built market share in the cloud industry and secured new investments. He also announced plans to expand its data center at its Redwood City, California, headquarters and bring data centers in Reston, Virginia, London and Turkey online in 2017.

On Dec. 16, White told Investors.com that he expected Oracle to see success after more than two years of stagnant stock performance.

The company has engaged in a number of high-profile acquisitions to help it compete against Salesforce.com (CRM). The two companies are competing to become the first cloud-based company to reach $10 billion in annual revenue.
