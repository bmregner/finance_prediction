{"body": "This June 18, 2012, file photo shows Oracle headquarters in Redwood City, Calif. The Labor Department is suing Oracle, claiming that the technology giant pays white male workers more than their non-white and female counterparts with the same job titles. In a statement issued Wednesday, Jan. 18, 2017, Oracle called the lawsuit \"politically motivated, based on false allegations and wholly without merit. ( Paul Sakuma / AP )\n\nThe local impact of a $502 million restructuring plan by Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL) remains unclear as the software firm looks to trim its hardware business amid declining revenue in an increasingly cloud-dependent landscape.\n\nThere have been unconfirmed reports of layoffs at the Broomfield campus — up to 200 workers, according to anonymous postings on discussion site The Layoff — but Oracle declined comment and no notice has been filed with the Colorado Department of Labor.\n\nA WARN (Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification) is warranted if the reductions at one location constitute more than a third of the workforce at that site.\n\nWARNs were filed in Austin, Texas, for the elimination of 71 positions and in Santa Clara, Calif., for cuts of up to 450, as reported by local media.\n\nIt's not known exactly how many people are employed at Broomfield's multi-building Oracle campus. The most recent estimate comes from a 2013 list of the area's top employers, when 1,900 workers were believed to be located there.\n\nOracle purchased Sun Microsytems in 2009 for $7.4 billion. At the time, the California-based tech company was the largest private sector employer in Boulder and Broomfield counties, with a local work force of 2,800.\n\nSun itself acquired Storage Technology Corp., the Louisville-based data storage giant, for $4.1 billion in 2005.\n\nBecause of Sun's big presence here, and large portfolio of hardware, local cuts are likely, according to Mark Cathcart, a former engineer with Dell and IBM.\n\n\"Their core business for many years was Sparc workstations — a pre-PC, customized engineering computer,\" Cathcart said.\n\nBut time and technology marched on, rendering the underlying SPARC technology largely obsolete. The SPARC chips, Cathcart said, aren't compatible with servers used today by tech giants like Amazon, Google and Facebook.\n\nNew technology \"pretty much chopped that marketplace off at the knees. It was just a question of how long they could sustain the former Sun business.\"\n\nPostings on the anonymous discussion forum The Layoff said many of the cuts were to the SPARC team.\n\nThe most recent confirmed reductions were in the hardware systems unit, and Oracle's co-chief executive Safra Catz said last month during a quarterly earnings call that the company was \"proactively evaluating\" expenses related to the hardware division.\n\nOracle's second quarter hardware revenue fell 13 percent compared to the previous second quarter report, and its software license revenue declined by 20 percent.\n\nCathcart said at big companies like Oracle and IBM, even outdated technologies are kept going \"as long as their top-line products are making money.\"\n\nBut when revenues start to dip, he said \"the writing is on the wall.\"", "category": "Oracle 1-26-17", "title": "As Oracle initiates layoffs nationwide, impacts in Broomfield unclear"}
