{"body": "Oracle Corporation (ORCL) is an interesting player in the Technology space, with a focus on Application Software. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $40.13, down from yesterday’s close by -0.05%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data.\n\nNo amount of research is complete without a bird’s eye view of the financial data. Oracle Corporation (ORCL) currently trades with a market capitalization of $161.90 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 0.47 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report.\n\nThe balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For ORCL, the company currently has $18.59 Billion of cash on the books, which is offset by $3.84 Billion current liabilities. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $12.57 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to grow in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $0.56 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 27.24% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors.\n\nSometimes, we can understand most about a stock by simply looking at how it has been trading. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Oracle Corporation recorded a 52-week high of $41.59. It is now trading 1.46% off that level. The stock is trading $39.50 its 50-day moving average by -0.63%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $33.61.\n\nIn recent action, Oracle Corporation (ORCL) has made a move of +3.37% over the past month, which has come on weak relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 8.15, and it’s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 1.08% with $2.97 Billion sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of ORCL.", "category": "Oracle 1-27-17", "title": "Oracle Corporation (ORCL): What’s the Story? | StockNewsJournal"}
