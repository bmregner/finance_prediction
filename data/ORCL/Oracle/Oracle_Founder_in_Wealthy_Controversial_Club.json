{"body": "Oracle Corp. (ORCL) co-founder Larry Ellison is part of an elite group of businessmen who have attracted the attention of income inequality advocates. On Monday, Ellison was listed by British-based anti-poverty advocate Oxfam as one of eight people who collectively own as much wealth as the bottom 50 percent (roughly 3.6 billion humans) of Earth's population. (See also: Are You in the Top One Percent of the World?)\n\nThe report is part of a paper calling for politicians and business people to address the consolidation of wealth at the top of the social spectrum. The release coincides with the start of the World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting in Davos, Switzerland. Oxfam’s paper is based on Forbes’ research and the annual Credit Suisse Global Wealth Databook. The latter report has tracked the global distribution of wealth since 2000.\n\nEllison joins seven other men on the list. The others are Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) Chairman Warren Buffett, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) founder Bill Gates, Spanish industrialist Amancio Ortega, Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, Amazon.com (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and Facebook (FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg. According to Oxfam and Forbes, Ellison is ranked the seventh wealthiest person in the world with a total net worth of $44 billion.

In January 2016, Oxfam calculated that the richest 62 people on the planet own as much wealth as the poorest 50 percent of the global population. Oxfam argues that politicians and economists must make this a more important issue in the 21st century. The firm warns that increased inequality will fuel increased populism and geopolitical changes similar to the 2016 election of President-elect Donald Trump and the decision by British voters to leave the European Union.
