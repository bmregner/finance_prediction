{"body": "According to sources, Don Johnson has replaced Peter Magnusson in directing Oracle Corporation’s (NYSE:ORCL) foray into public cloud services. Johnson joined Oracle in 2014 having previously worked as a senior engineer at Amazon Web Services. On his LinkedIn profile, Johnson’s title now reads as senior vice president. Previously he was vice president.\n\nThe development comes a few days after Oracle co-CEO Mark Hurd and president Thomas Kurian announced a range of services as they gave updates on the progress the company was making with its cloud business. The availability of Oracle’s database from bare-metal servers hosted by the enterprise software giant was announced as well as a cloud-based load balancer.\n\nCompared to some of its major rivals Oracle has a lot of ground to cover as it is late to the public cloud segment. The company had in 2009 publicly disparaged the public cloud model where public cloud service providers build data centers for hire to customers. Oracle, however, later changed tune and jumped on the public cloud bandwagon. In 2016 the enterprise software maker earned $1.1 billion in revenues from its cloud business.\n\nMost of the cloud revenues that the tech company earned were, however, from Oracle’s own business software delivered over the cloud and not from the cloud infrastructure services the likes of Amazon offer. The distinction is important since Amazon’s modern model is the one being employed in a majority of modern application development efforts.\n\nCritics say that Oracle will find it difficult to match the investments that its cloud rivals such as International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are making in cloud infrastructure services. One advantage that Oracle has is an existing presence in the majority of Global 2000 companies,. The danger, though, is that those same companies may have their eyes out for an alternative and competitive service such as the cloud-based Amazon Redshift.\n\nIn Thursday’s trading, Oracle Corporation edged downwards by 0.05 percent to close the day at $40.13.\n\nAdvanced Real-Time Chart: If not automatically loaded with the correct symbol related to this article, you can manually enter it (ex.
