{"body": "UBS reiterated a Buy rating and $45.00 price target on Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) following reports that the company has downsized its hardware unit workforce .\n\nAnalyst Brent Thill commented, \"Earlier, Fortune/San Jose Mercury News reported ORCL has downsized its hardware unit workforce, with estimates ranging from 450-1800 FTEs. This puts in motion CFO Catz's F2Q17 earnings call commentary around the \"proactive\" evaluation of opex supporting the on-premise hardware segment, in light of the declines it has seen over a multi-year period. ORCL's hardware products business is -7% on a 3-yr CAGR basis and has shrunk by 44% to $2.5B since FY11, the first full year following the Jan'10 Sun acquisition. While the headcount reductions are in small scale relative to ORCL's 140K+ worldwide FTE base, the restructuring makes sense in the context of what we see as a secularly declining business with UBSe forecasting mid-teens declines thru FY19.\"\n\nFor an analyst ratings summary and ratings history on Oracle click here.
