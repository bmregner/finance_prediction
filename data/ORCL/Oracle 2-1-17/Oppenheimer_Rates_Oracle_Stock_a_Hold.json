{"body": "On Jan. 20, Oppenheimer analyst Brian Schwartz reiterated a Hold rating on Oracle Corp. (ORCL). At the time of his rating, Schwartz was a five-star analyst with an average return of 18.5 percent and a 68.9 percent success rate, according to TipRanks.com. Schwartz was ranked No. 13 out of 4,369 analysts and No. 25 out of 10,124 experts on the accountability platform.\n\nSchwartz noted in a report accessed by Markets.co that company management was upbeat about the firm’s outlook in the wake of its CloudWorld conference. (See also: What Oracle’s Aggressive Cloud Initiative Means.)\n\n“While there was some incremental quantitative information (nothing material), the overall tone was confident and positive. We believe Oracle’s single-supplier value proposition offers the business technical and competitive advantages, but our ‘cloud vendor hype survey’ indicates Oracle and IBM messaging may be overshadowing the technology maturity and/or capabilities,” Schwartz wrote.\n\nSchwartz warned that even though Oracle stock now trades at an attractive price due to poor performance against its benchmark, he believed that the company’s committed spending on a “public cloud” could impact the firm’s cash flow.\n\n“While the current set up for Oracle shares looks attractive because of poor price performance versus benchmarks and low sentiment, we surmise that the accelerating spending plans for a dilutive category 'public cloud,' the maintenance growth challenges for the business, and distraction/integration expenses from NetSuite, will stress Oracle’s cash flow growth and earnings power over the next 12 to 24 months and keep the stock range-bound,” Schwartz wrote.\n\nThe report came just days after Oracle received two Buy ratings from Wall Street analysts. On Jan. 18, Jeffries analyst John Difucci set a Buy rating with a price target of $51.00. That same day, Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White reiterated a Buy rating with a $47.00 price target.
