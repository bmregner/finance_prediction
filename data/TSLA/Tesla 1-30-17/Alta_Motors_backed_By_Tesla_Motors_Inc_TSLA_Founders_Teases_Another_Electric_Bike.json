{"body": "Tesla Motors, Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) electric cars are probably the best in the world right now with the company continuing to push more updates to make them even better with the founders deserving all the credit for coming up with this initiative. Tesla founders Marc Tarpenning and Martin Eberhard invested in a Series A funding round of electric motorcycle company Alta Motors who have now unveiled a new bike according to a report by Electrek.\n\nThe electric bike maker already has launched two variants back in August which includes motocross RedShift MX and the other supermoto RedShift SM. The RedShift MX has a starting price of $15,000 while the street version starts off with a price of $15,500. However, the company is now extending its range lineup in a bid to attract more people.\n\nThe new ST concept that the company has come up reduces the seat height to only 31.5 inches while the previous models had a seat height of up to 37 inches. It is expected that the company will use the same battery packs that it has used it is the previous model which suggests that the bike will have a range of 50 miles with a top speed of 80 mph.\n\nThe company gave no price details of the bike along with the expected production and delivery date. The bike will be officially announced by the company at the One Moto Show in Portland with more details coming out then. But if all things are taken into account and production gets underway this year, Alta would only be able to deliver the bikes in2018.\n\nAlta Motors was previously called BRD Motorcycles, and it was at that time when Tesla founders made an investment in the company. Modara Technologies led the investment round at that point with other venture capitalists joining in.", "category": "Tesla 1-30-17", "title": "Alta Motors backed By Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Founders Teases Another Electric Bike"}
