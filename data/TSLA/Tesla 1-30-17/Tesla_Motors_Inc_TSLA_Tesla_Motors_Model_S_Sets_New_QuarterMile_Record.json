{"body": "Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) recently rolled out a Ludicrous Plus upgrade for its fleet of cars, tuning them more powerful and more exotic. Drag Times has checked the performance of the Model S P100D with the Ludicrous Plus mode on the track, testing out its quarter-mile efficiency. According to an Electrek’s report, Drag Times managed to set a new record of covering the quarter mile in 10.72 seconds only.\n\nEver since the company has rolled out the mode, there have not been quarter mile drag races. Rather, we have seen people trying to achieve the 0-60 mph acceleration in 2.3 seconds. Drag Times took three fully-charged Model S P100D cars on the track, checking the quarter-mile performance and ensuring that the best performance is achievable.\n\nHowever, Drag Times could only manage two passes due to the rush at the track, as there was no rain, and it was a perfect day for racing. One of the Tesla cars managed 10.82 seconds in the quarter mile, while the Model S P100D broke the record, becoming the quickest Tesla car which is currently traveling on the roads.\n\nTesla’s Model S joined the list of the 10-second cars when the company launched its Ludicrous mode. The 10-second cars are those who can travel the quarter mile in less than 11 seconds. However, since the update to the Ludicrous Plus mode, there were always speculations that the electric sedan would do well on the race track like it has been doing to attain the 2.3 seconds mark in 0-60 mph acceleration.\n\nCEO Elon Musk has already said that the new upgrade was enough to achieve the 10.6-second mark in the quarter mile race. Drag Times has hit the 10.72 seconds barrier, and it will be about the time when we see a Tesla car making it to the 10.6 mark. He has also said that 0-60 mph in 2.3 seconds will be achievable, and it was achieved last week in 2.389 seconds.\n\nYou can watch the complete video here.", "category": "Tesla 1-30-17", "title": "Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA): Tesla Motors Model S Sets New Quarter-Mile Record"}
