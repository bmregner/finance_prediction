{"body": "Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has been expanding its network all over the world at a rapid pace, with Hong Kong being one of those markets for the company. The Palo Alto Company is already present in the region, but now it has gone one step ahead with the delivery of its Model X, according to a report by Inside EVs.\n\nThe electric car maker handed out keys of Model X to owners at an event held at the Central Soho district. The event was attended by current and future Tesla owners. Six first owners of Model X were given the keys during the Live Event, who then drove through the stage to take the first ride of their Model X.\n\nOnce the car keys were handed over to the six owners, a runway was set up in front of the stage so that Model X could be driven off. This was the first time that the Model X was driven on the roads of Hong Kong. Mark Webb-Johnson who is the Chairman of Charged Hong Kong was one of the six lucky owners to get a Model X and was present at the event along with his family.\n\nMark said about the event and car, “The event had an amazing atmosphere. So many people were excited to see the car finally delivering in HK after such a long wait for us reservation holders. We felt privileged and honored to be amongst the first to take delivery. Personally, I am grateful to see another new Electric Vehicle option launched in HK. This car, with its seven seats, is great for larger families.”\n\nJust like the Model S owners in the country, Model X owners also had to wait for three years before getting their hands on the SUV. However, Model X could be seen regularly at local showrooms or different events. Delivering the car right before the Chinese New Year is a good gesture from Tesla, considering it has been a long wait for customers.\n\nYou can watch a small clip of the presentation here.", "category": "Tesla 1-30-17", "title": "Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) Starts Delivering Model X in Hong Kong"}
