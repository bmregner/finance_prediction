{"body": "Tesla Motor Inc.'s (TSLA) Model S and BMW Group's i3 have not qualified to receive a \"Top Safety Pick\" award from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS).\n\n\"There's no reason the most efficient vehicles can't also be among the safest,\" says David Zuby, IIHS executive vice president and chief research officer. \"We hope Tesla and BMW will continue to refine the designs of their electric models to maximize driver protection and, especially in the case of Tesla, improve their headlights.\"\n\nFounded in 1959, IIHS is a Virginia-based nonprofit research group supported by auto insurers and insurance associations. Safety ratings don't just give an owner piece of mind, they also affect auto insurance premiums. Cars which earn good ratings in five \"crashworthiness\" tests and have an \"advanced\" or \"superior\" front crash prevention system, are given a \"Top Safety Pick\" award. Those which also come with good or acceptable headlights, earn a \"Top Safety Pick+\" award.

The luxury sedan received only an \"acceptable\" rating in the small overlap front test, which simulates a collision of the front corner of the vehicle with another object, like a tree or a vehicle.

That allowed the dummy's head to hit the steering wheel hard through the airbag. Measurements from the dummy indicated that injuries to the head, along with the lower right leg, would be possible in a real-world crash of the same severity,\" said IIHS.\n\nThe Model S was not tested for crash prevention since the software hasn't been activated for all vehicles. The Model S' headlights were also panned. Tesla says it is working with its supplier to improve the headlights, and has made production changes to fix the aforementioned head-contact problem.\n\nThe BMW i3 received only an \"acceptable\" rating in the head restraint and seat evaluation, which measures a vehicle's ability to protect against neck injuries in a rear crash, and for its headlights. \"BMW clearly thought a lot about safety when designing the i3,\" Zuby says. \"It's a shame that it missed the mark on head restraints, which is something most of today's vehicles get right. Among small cars, the i3 is the only 2017 model that doesn't earn a good rating.\"", "category": "Tesla 2-1-17", "title": "Tesla Model S Fails to Earn Top Safety Rating"}
