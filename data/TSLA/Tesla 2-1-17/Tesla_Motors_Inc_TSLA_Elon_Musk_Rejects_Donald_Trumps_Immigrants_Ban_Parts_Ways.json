{"body": "Tesla Motors Inc.’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock performance in 2017 has puzzled some analysts given its high-profile annual deliveries guidance miss posted earlier this month. Investors are broadly connecting the near 19% stock price rally to the fact that CEO Elon Musk and the new American president Donald Trump seem to be getting along well.\n\nThat image may have been shattered, as CEO – who earlier this month was a pick of the lot at Donald Trump’s breakfast meeting on manufacturing – is out in the open criticizing Trump’s recently-imposed ban on immigrants coming in from several territories, some terrible war stricken.\n\nHe recently took to Twitter, expressing his discontent. He remarked, “The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country’s challenges.\" The CEO was recently appointed as a member of the Strategic and Policy Forum, as well as a crucial pillar to Trump’s newly-created manufacturing council. Both his positions have brought some criticism to the genius entrepreneur.\n\nElon Musk’s cry-out against Donald Trump – although not related to business at all – still signifies the possibility of a disagreement between them. And investors are perhaps already panicking. Shares of Tesla were down 0.34% in pre-market trading today.\n\nSuch a notion, however, is not new. Donald Trump’s entire election campaign was run on claims bashing environmental-friendly companies, such as Tesla eating up on significant tax money. The billionaire real-estate tycoon has also been pressing hard for the American manufacturers and service companies to bring their operations back to the US, thus boosting American jobs.\n\nWhile Tesla does not yet have any major manufacturing functions abroad besides a single assembly plant in Europe, the company has already expressed interest in deploying a second Gigafactory in Germany, and there are already talks among analysts of Tesla’s inevitable need to team up with a Chinese manufacturer to start building Tesla cars in China. That move is crucial given Tesla has so far been left out of much of electric vehicles-related incentives in China – as these benefits go to manufacturers, making vehicles in China domestically.", "category": "Tesla 2-1-17", "title": "Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA): Elon Musk Rejects Donald Trump's Immigrants' Ban, Parts Ways"}
