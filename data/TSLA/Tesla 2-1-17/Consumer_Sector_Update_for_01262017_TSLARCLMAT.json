{"body": "Consumer stocks continued to widen their differences this afternoon, with shares of consumer staples companies in the S&P 500 falling about 0.3% while shares of consumer discretionary firms in the S&P 500 were posting a nearly 0.3% advance.\n\nIn company news, Tesla Motors ( TSLA ) almost climbed back to its starting point today, with shares of the electric-auto manufacturer paring earlier losses that followed reports the company earlier this week had canceled a 100 million euro ($107 million) order for axle-drive pumps, saying they failed to meet its requirements.\n\nA source familiar with the order told the German news website Electrek that Tesla had ordered the parts for its Model 3 roadster in September from SHW Automotive. Tesla's decision to cancel the order prompted speculation elsewhere in the German media that it may be giving into to pressure from the new U.S. administration and President Donald Trump threatening large border fees for goods produced outside the U.S. and then returned for sale, the news outlet said.\n\nSHW said it disagreed with Tesla's reasons for cancelling the order, adding it reserves the right to seek damages. It was unclear if they have yet done so, Electrek said.\n\nTSLA shares were down about 0.7% at $252.80 each, returning within 50 cents of its break-even mark late today before drifting lower again just before the closing bell. The stock previously had dropped to a session low of $250.75 a share around 10:30 a.m. ET, falling about 1.5%.\n\n(+) RCL, Adjusted Q4 EPS of $1.23 beats by $0.02 per share.
