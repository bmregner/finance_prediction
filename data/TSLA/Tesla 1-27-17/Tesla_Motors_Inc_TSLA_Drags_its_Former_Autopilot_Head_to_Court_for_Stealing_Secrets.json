{"body": "Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has been involved in legal problems in the past for different reasons which also includes its Autopilot feature. But now the company has decided to go to court themselves, against its former director of the Autopilot Program Sterling Anderson who is being accused by the carmaker of taking away confidential information along with him at the time of departure.\n\nTesla filed a lawsuit against its former executive as he improperly recruited engineers of Tesla Motors to create his autonomous car startup company. According to the lawsuit, Mr. Anderson has breached his employment contract with the Palo Alto company as he tried to recruit its employees after leaving.\n\nApart from hiring employees, Tesla has also said that the former Autopilot head has stolen a lot of data from the company which it has been using for the company that he founded. The data, according to Tesla, is worth \"hundreds of gigabytes\" and is the confidential property of the company. Even Sterling Anderson's partner at Aurora, Chris Urmson, is accused of hiring Tesla engineers.\n\nTesla in its lawsuit said, \"Anderson and his business partners, including Christopher Urmson, the recently departed head of Google's self-driving car initiative, decided to take a run at similar fortune. Unlike other recent startups, however, Anderson and Urmson sought an unfair advantage. While employed at Tesla, Anderson secretly set out to hire Tesla engineers for his own venture.\"\n\nHowever, both Anderson and Urmson have said that the claims made by Tesla Motors are totally baseless. In a statement made to Electrek, they stated that the lawsuit is meritless and it has been made by the company as a fear of competition. They said that they will continue to work on autonomous technology and will build their self-driving car and challenge the allegations in court.\n\nTesla has made progress with its Autopilot feature after getting the clearance from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) regarding the fatal car crash of Model S, last year. The electric car maker is already facing serious competition from another startup company Faraday Future that unveiled its first electric car, FF91, this month.", "category": "Tesla 1-27-17", "title": "Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Drags its Former Autopilot Head to Court for Stealing Secrets"}
