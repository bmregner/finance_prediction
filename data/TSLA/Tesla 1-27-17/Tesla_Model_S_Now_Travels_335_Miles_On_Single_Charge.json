{"body": "Tesla Motors Corp. (TSLA) owners can now drive farther in their Model S sedans. The 100 D, which is the Model S’ latest version, now has a mileage of 335 miles on a single battery charge. The previous version of the Model S had mileage range of 315 miles for the same battery.\n\nModel S competitors typically have lower mileage range. For example, General Motor Company’s (GM) electric vehicle Chevrolet Bolt has a range of 238 miles on a single battery charge. However, as the Wall Street Journal points out, the Chevy Bolt retails for $36,120 and upwards. On the other hand, the Model S 100D is priced at $93,700 and upwards.

The Palo Alto-based company has set a rapid pace of innovation for its competitors in the electric car industry by releasing hardware and software upgrades every six to eight months. For customers, the new features can be a double-edged sword. While they welcome the improvements in car features and performance, the innovations come with additional upgrade costs and problems associated with retrofits. This is because Tesla does not follow the model followed by regular car companies, which issue annual hardware upgrades.\n\nHowever, Tesla CEO Elon Musk is not backing down on his commitment to improving Tesla cars and boosting their performance. In an exchange on Twitter Inc.’s (TWTR) platform, he said Tesla will “never stop innovating.” He also promised major revisions to the car every 12 to 18 months. This year, the electric car company is firing on all cylinders to design and produce the Model 3, its first mass-market electric car. Prices for the Model 3 are expected to start at $35,000 onwards.
