{"body": "SpaceX, the private commercial rocket launch service owned by Tesla Motors, Inc. (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, will launch its Falcon 9 rocket on Monday, January 9 from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.\n\nIn a tweet Thursday, Musk said: “All systems are go for launch next week.”\n\nMusk didn’t go into much detail about the the exact time of the launch, Space Coast Daily on Thursday noted that the blastoff is scheduled for 7:28 a.m. ET Monday. The Falcon 9 rocket, which was originally scheduled for launch in mid-December, was postponed because SpaceX said it needed more time to take extra precautionary measures after the September 1 accident of the Falcon 9 accident, which destroyed a $200 million Spacecom satellite to be used by Facebook (FB).\n\nThe dramatic September 1 accident, which Musk called the most \"difficult and complex failure\" he and his team have faced in 14 years, originated in the upper stage of the Falcon rocket during a routine test firing in Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\nThe launch has a the goal of putting into orbit a constellation of ten communication satellites for Iridium Communications, a company based in McLean, Virginia. A successful launch could engender confidence that SpaceX can deliver and draw back some clients who have bypassed SpaceX for other launch companies.\n\nWhether the rocket does take flight Monday remains to be seen, however. Noozhawk, which cited Hank Price, spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration’s Office of Commercial Space Transportation, said the agency had not yet issued SpaceX a license to launch in January. Likewise, because of the accident, SpaceX also needs clearance from NASA before it can resume flights.\n\nSpaceX in November issued a request to U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) seeking approval to operate a massive satellite network that would provide high-speed, global internet coverage. According to newly filed documents, SpaceX hopes to operate an orbiting digital communications array consisting of 4,425 satellites. It is unknown whether that license has been granted.", "category": "Tesla 1-27-17", "title": "Elon Musk's SpaceX Launches Monday: What to Expect? (TSLA, FB)"}
