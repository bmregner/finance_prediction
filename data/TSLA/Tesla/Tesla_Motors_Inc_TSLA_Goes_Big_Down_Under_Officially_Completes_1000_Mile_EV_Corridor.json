{"body": "Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has gone big in the land down under already; and looking at the company’s plans, it could well just be the start. The company has completed the 1,000-mile corridor between the cities of Melbourne and Brisbane which should allow Tesla owners to drive their EVs entirely off Tesla supercharger stations located strategically on the route.\n\nTesla said three additional charging stations have been installed along the route to complete the 1,000-mile long corridor.\n\nThe stations built just now include the \"big banana\" in Coffs Harbor, \"Motto Farm\" in Heatherbrae and \"Macadamia Castle\" in Knockrow. However, as previously announced, Tesla still needs some development work in the Coffs Harbor station and as a result, has installed two temporary Supercharger units in the area to serve as a replacement until the Tesla's own supercharger station gets up and going.\n\nTesla has plans on having 18 supercharger stations in Australia by the end of the current year which would increase the count significantly from the 11 operational supercharger stations as of now, with another two under construction.\n\nTesla says all stations in Australia have been strategically placed to be 150 miles apart of less which allows for Tesla owners to drive freely without having to worry about running out of charge before another supercharger station shows up.\n\nAustralia is fast emerging as an important market for Tesla given the interest that the Australians have shown for Tesla’s energy products. The country also hosts some of Tesla's most upscale exclusive distribution stores for its vehicles and energy products.\n\nThe mature Australian market, just like some of the European markets, poses as a strong market for Tesla’s forthcoming mass-market electric Model 3 sedan that will go on sale in the US later this year.", "category": "Tesla", "title": "Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Goes Big Down Under; Officially Completes 1,000 Mile EV Corridor"}
