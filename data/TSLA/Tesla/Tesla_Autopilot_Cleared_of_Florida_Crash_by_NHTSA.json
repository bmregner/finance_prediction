{"body": "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has cleared Tesla Motors, Inc.'s (TSLA) Autopilot feature of fault in the death of a Florida driver last June. The government agency, which began an investigation into the case last June, wrote that \"it did not find any defects in design or performance of AEB (Automatic Emergency Braking) and Autopilot systems of the object nor any incidents in which the system did not perform as designed.\"\n\nAn NHTSA spokesman told Bloomberg that Tesla was not under investigation after yesterday. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that the NHTSA decision was \"very positive.\"\n\nThe electric car maker's stock price tanked, and it was excoriated by the media, following the death of a Tesla driver on a Florida highway last year. Under pressure from government regulators and media around the world, it modified the Autopilot feature last year to include an increased role for radars in detecting objects in its path. As of this writing, the stock is up by almost 8% for this year.

This is because it absolves them of responsibility in certain crash conditions, such as the one last June. A negative assessment by NHTSA would have sent the industry back to the drawing board to insert additional safety features and, quite possibly, delayed introduction of the self-driving feature in cars.
