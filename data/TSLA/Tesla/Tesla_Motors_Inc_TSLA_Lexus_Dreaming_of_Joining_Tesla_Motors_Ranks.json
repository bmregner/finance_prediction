{"body": "Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) which was once ridiculed for being a no-match to the major global automakers, is now apparently inspiring some of the greatest players. These include mainstream automakers like General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) which is rivaling Tesla's forthcoming mass-market Model 3 sedan with a mainstream EV of its own, and even luxury automakers like BMW and Mercedes-Benz.\n\nToyota's Lexus notably has been a stark critic of all-electric vehicles touting hybrid vehicles instead. But it seems, even Lexus is ready to join Tesla's ranks now.\n\nLast month at the North American International Auto Show, the luxury vehicle maker's General Manager Jeff Bracken hinted on the possibility of an all-electric Lexus soon. He talked about Lexus being eager on filling some gaps in the luxury electric vehicles market – pointing succinctly at the lack of any electric vehicle offerings from the brand.\n\nIn fact, Mr. Bracken said Lexus' aim at the potential development of an all-electric powertrain began at the 2016 Paris Motor Show were the pick of the lot were mostly plug-in vehicles.\n\nStill, he said the primary reason Lexus could be venturing the all-electric road is the plain old emissions regulation excuse. He said, \"I think we'd have our head buried in the sand if we didn't thoroughly study all electric. You definitely have to do that.\"\n\nBesides Tesla, almost all the key automakers across the globe, as well as several electric vehicle startups, are jumping in to warm up the electric vehicles segment which still constitutes less than 1% of the global auto industry.\n\nBut industry experts claim that with automakers like Tesla around, electric vehicle sales could skyrocket and grow \"exponentially\" starting the end of the decade as battery technology catches up to the needs of longer-distance all-electric mileage and the cost and hence prices for electric vehicles come down.\n\nThis year, both Tesla and General Motors are rolling their mid-priced all-electric vehicles in America with eventual plans for global deliveries.", "category": "Tesla", "title": "Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA): Lexus Dreaming of Joining Tesla Motors Ranks"}
