{"body": "Elon Musk, chief executive of electric carmaker Tesla (TSLA), surprised many when he tweeted his support for Trump's Secretary of State pick Rex Tillerson late Tuesday night.\n\nMusk fended off criticism of Tillerson on the social networking website and called him an \"exceptionally competent executive.\" He pointed out that the former Exxon Mobil (XOM) CEO accepts that climate change is real and believes it warrants action.\n\nMusk and Tillerson both support a revenue-neutral carbon tax. A carbon tax imposed on emissions of carbon dioxide is meant to discourage the burning of fossil fuel and promote innovation. A revenue-neutral carbon tax ensures that other taxes are cut in order to offset the impact. (See also: Could a Carbon Tax Work?)\n\nWhy does it matter what Tillerson believes? Climate change is a global issue, and as Secretary of State, Tillerson can lead the conversation with other nations. He said at his Senate Committee hearing, “I think it’s important that the United States maintain its seat at the table in the conversation on how to address threats of climate change. They do require a global response. No one country is going to solve this alone,” he said.​\n\nExxon Mobil has previously come out in support of a carbon tax, but critics wrote it off as lip service or an attempt to undermine the coal industry since natural gas, which Exxon focuses on, produces much less carbon than coal. Exxon is also being investigated by the SEC for how it factors in climate risk in pricing its projects.\n\nRegardless, support for a carbon tax would be hard to find in the Republican-controlled Senate and Congress. The GOP platform website says, \"We oppose any carbon tax. It would increase energy prices across the board, hitting hardest at the families who are already struggling to pay their bills in the Democrats’ no-growth economy. We urge the private sector to focus its resources on the development of carbon capture and sequestration technology still in its early stages here and overseas.\"\n\nTrump has also said he plans to pull the U.S. out of the historic Paris Climate Agreement. Just as well since the nonpartisan Resources for Future found that the United States will not meet its Paris Agreement pledge for greenhouse gas emissions in 2025 with current policies and previously proposed regulations.", "category": "Tesla", "title": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk Tweets Support for Rex Tillerson"}
