{"body": "As part of its ride toward a fully self-driving car, electric car maker Tesla Motors, Inc. (TSLA) rolled out a software update this past weekend that enables some aspects of its Enhanced Autopilot feature for customers. The feature adds $5,000 to the retail price of the company's Model S sedan and Model X cars. It makes use of four (out of a total of eight) cameras, a radar and 12 ultrasonic sensors.\n\nThe full Enhanced Autopilot feature enables Tesla cars to perform a variety of driving-related tasks autonomously. This includes automatically matching speed with surrounding traffic (limited to 45 miles per hour in the current update), changing lanes without driver input, merging lanes on highways and auto parking. However, the Palo Alto, Calif.-based company is rolling out the feature in phases. This past weekend's phase enables active cruise control, forward collision warning and auto steer.

That update was active in a fleet of 1,000 cars and was in data-gathering \"Shadow Mode\" for the remaining cars. The company is using data gathered from that phase to make improvements to its system. (See also: Tesla Updates Autopilot Software.)\n\nIn a tweet, Tesla CEO Elon Musk stated that the company would introduce fully self-driving features within the next three to six months. The fully self-driving option will set customers back by $8,000 and will use all eight cameras installed in the car. The company intends to showcase its self-driving capability by having the car undertake a fully autonomous road trip from Los Angeles to Times Square in New York City.\n\nTesla's recent Autopilot-related announcements are a dramatic turnaround for the company. Less than seven months ago, it was reeling under intense media criticism for the same feature after the death of a driver on a Florida highway. Under pressure, it released a software upgrade for the Autopilot feature last September. That upgrade expanded sensor and radar capabilities to detect objects in inclement weather conditions.\n\nSubsequently, the company doubled down on self-driving by announcing in October that all cars in production would henceforth be equipped with self-driving hardware. Recently, Tesla was absolved by the NHTSA for Autopilot's role in the Florida accident. In fact, the government agency stated that Autopilot reduced accident probability by 40% based on data provided by the company.
