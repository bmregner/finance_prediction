{"body": "Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk is already known for coming up with crazy ideas due to which he is always a standout amongst other executives in the industry. Last year in December Musk came up with yet another surprising idea, and that was to establish a “boring” tunnel digging company to reduce the traffic congestion on roads.\n\nWhile a lot of people may not have paid any heed to Musk’s idea, but the Tesla CEO himself appears to be a lot of serious about his boring project as he looks to start digging tunnels soon. Elon Musk in his tweet said that progress on the tunnel project has been exciting so far and he expects to start digging within a month or so.\n\nSome people still thought Elon Musk is definitely not serious about the project when they asked him whether he is serious about digging tunnels to which Musk replied he is serious. But the question in the mind of a lot of people was from where the “Boring” company will start digging a tunnel and how long will it be.\n\nMusk answered this question as well when he said that he has plans to build a tunnel which will start from his office desk at Space X. the tunnel would end at the 105 Freeway which is near the LAX, an airport that is frequently visited by Musk due to his active participation in Tesla Motors, SolarCity, and Space X.\n\nElon Musk came up with the idea of digging tunnels as the traffic was driving him nuts. He said that he would just build a tunnel boring machine and start digging. Traffic congestion has been a problem due to a lot of cars already on the roads, and it will be interesting to see whether Musk can actually pull it off and build a tunnel from his office.", "category": "Tesla", "title": "Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA): Tesla CEO Elon Musk Gets Serious to Build Tunnels"}
