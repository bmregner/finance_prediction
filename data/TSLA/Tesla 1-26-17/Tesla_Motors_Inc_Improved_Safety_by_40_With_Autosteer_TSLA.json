{"body": "The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has completed a six-month investigation into a fatal accident involving a Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s vehicle equipped with a semi-autonomous Autopilot system. The agency will not pursue a safety recall a recall as it did not find any faults in the automaker’s Autopilot system, Fortune reported.\n\nLast year, Joshua Brown was killed in a fatal accident when his 2015 Tesla Model S struck with a tractor-trailer in Williston, Florida. The Model S was being operated in Autopilot mode at the time of the collision. The agency was probing whether the Automatic Emergency Braking or Autopilot systems were responsible for the Brown’s death.\n\nAccording to the NHTSA, it did not find any defects in the design or performance of the Automatic Emergency Braking or Autopilot systems nor any incidents in which the systems did not perform as designed.\n\nMoreover, the agency found that new technology Tesla added to the Autopilot system increased the safety of its electric cars.\n\nTesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is now equipping new Model S and Model X vehicles with a new system dubbed Hardware 2. It is a more robust suite of sensors, cameras, and radar and software that will eventually enable Tesla cars to become fully drive autonomous.\n\nThe automaker is now offers two options to customers: an Enhanced Autopilot system or a Full Self-Driving Capability. The full self-driving capability will have eight cameras, ultrasonic sensors, radar, and a supercomputer capable of processing data 40 times faster than previously.\n\nIn September last year, Tesla released its 8.0 firmware update to the Autopilot system which included changes in the driver monitoring strategy, as well as several enhancements to the Automatic Emergency Braking, Dynamic Brake Support, and Traffic-Aware Cruise Control performance.\n\nAccording to the agency, Tesla’s crash rate dropped by almost 40% after Autosteer — a component of the Autopilot system— was enabled.\n\nAutosteer is designed to keep vehicles within the lane and detect vehicles and objects. It uses information from the forward-looking camera, the radar sensor, and the ultrasonic sensors, to detect lane markings as well as the presence of vehicles and objects.\n\nThe agency concludes that the Automatic Emergency Braking system “are rear-end collision avoidance technologies that are not designed to reliably perform in all crash modes, including crossing path collisions,” according to the NHTSA report.\n\nThe report added that “advanced driver assistance systems, such as Tesla’s Autopilot, require the continual and full attention of the driver to monitor the traffic environment and be prepared to take action to avoid crashes.”\n\nThe agency noted that automated emergency braking systems have limitations and may not always detect threats or provide warnings or automatic braking early enough to avoid collisions.\n\nTesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has made changes to the system, adding a hands-on the steering wheel system for monitoring driver engagement. In addition, the system has been updated to reinforce the need for driver engagement through a “strike out” strategy. Drivers that do not respond to visual cues in the driver monitoring system alerts may “strike out” and lose Autopilot function for the remainder of the drive cycle.", "category": "Tesla 1-26-17", "title": "Tesla Motors Inc Improved Safety by 40% With Autosteer (TSLA)"}
