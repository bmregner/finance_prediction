{"body": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)‘s iPhones and devices running Google’s Android OS are in a battle for the wallets of consumers. iPhones are premium and somewhat exclusive with Apple exerting strong control over hardware and software. The Android ecosystem is open with hundreds of brands making smartphones for all the different market segments. Interestingly, first-tier Android OEMs such as Samsung, HTC, and Sony are building premium devices on par with Apple’s iPhone.\n\nThe question “Which is better between Android devices and iPhone” will yield different kinds of answers depending on who you ask. Interestingly, consumers tend to vote with their wallets; hence, sales figures from specific markets can provide an insight into who is winning the smartphone wars at any snapshot in time. This piece explores recent sales trends between iOS and Android on two continents.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has maintained market leadership in sales of smartphones in China since 2012. The Chinese upwardly mobile middle class are buying up iPhone as a status symbol and the gold-colored model sells faster than Apple can make them because of the traditional Chinese love for gold. However, the firm was knocked off its high horse in 2016 after relatively smaller upstart Oppo came to the market with the Oppo R9.\n\nMarket data from Counterpoint Research showed that Oppo sold 17 million units of the R9 in China in 2016. The massive sales of the R9 helped Oppo to capture a bigger slice of the Chinese pie and Oppo now controls a 4% market share in China. In contrast, Apple sold 12 million units of the iPhone 6S in China last year. The iPhone maker not controls a 2% market share to play second fiddle to Oppo. More interesting is the fact that Oppo’s shipment to China in 2016 increased by 106% while Apple’s shipment to the country in 2016 declined by 21%.\n\nOne of the reasons behind the declining sales of iPhone in China is that the average Chinese now has less discretionary income to spend on status symbols. The Chinese economy is yet to recover from its flash crunch and the government is cracking down on ostentatious display of wealth. One could also submit that the Chinese are not willing to shell out top dollar for the latest iPhone since it only has ‘marginal’ improvements over the previous model.\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) might be losing its shine in China but its latest iPhone 7 is enjoying a warm response in the Enterprise segment of UK’s smartphone market.  A report submits that U.K’s Ministry of Defense might have chosen the iPhone 7 over rival products in the Android ecosystem to handle secure calls.\n\nThe UK military believes that the iPhone offers the best in-class mobile security system and it has tasked British Telecom with enhancing the security features of the iPhone 7 for use in military communications.\n\nSteve Bunn, technical business manager for defense at British Telecom revealed that the plan to use a consumer-grade device was originally focused on Samsung Galaxy Note 4. The engineers later observed that the Note 4 wasn’t secure enough; hence, they switched to the iPhone 7. The enhanced iPhone 7 wil now have a “Dual Persona” in which users can select different modes “Official ” or “Secret” based on the clearance level required for different calls.", "category": "Apple Inc 1-30-17", "title": "Apple Inc.
