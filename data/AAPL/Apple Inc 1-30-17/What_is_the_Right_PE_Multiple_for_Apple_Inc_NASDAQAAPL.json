{"body": "Before earnings hit tomorrow, UBS steps back and consider factors behind Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) valuation. The core drivers are return on invested capital (ROIC) and growth. Although discounted cash flow is theoretically the best approach as it explicitly addresses the drivers, investors often use the more convenient P/E, for which the drivers are implicit.\n\nIn Apple's case, ROIC is high and growth more of a challenge. Consequently, the P/E would be more enhanced by improvements in growth than in returns. UBS thinks a P/E of range of 13-15x is appropriate for now; the mid-point supports UBS price target of $127.\n\nA common mistake is to determine P/E based on comparison to a company with a similar profit margin or growth while overlooking differing ROICs or costs of capital. Also, earnings growth only enhances value when incremental profit achieves a return on incremental invested capital above the cost of capital. UBS thinks about P/E in two parts: current earnings capitalized at a zero growth multiple and a growth factor reflecting rising NOPAT at a return above cost of capital.\n\nAn appropriate zero growth P/E for Apple is about 13x, not much below the current 13.7x. If there is little beyond the iPhone, that could be correct or even optimistic. However, UBS projects mid-single digit NOPAT growth over five years at a 15-25% ROIC, supporting a P/E of 13-15x. An important takeaway is that Apple's P/E would be more enhanced by an acceleration in growth than a higher ROIC. Every three-point increase in growth yields a one turn increase in the multiple while Apple would have to almost double its ROIC to achieve a one turn boost in the multiple. Consequently, UBS believes management should prioritize growth, which could mean diluting margin as long as new business earns its cost of capital.\n\nOptions imply a 4% stock move after results. UBS price target is $127 or 14x F17e EPS. Apple's discount to the market of 25% should narrow toward its average of 20%.", "category": "Apple Inc 1-30-17", "title": "What is the Right P/E Multiple for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)?"}
