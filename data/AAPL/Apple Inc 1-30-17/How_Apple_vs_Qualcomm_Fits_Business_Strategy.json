{"body": "In the annals of business relationships, the one between Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM) is a complicated one. Even as Apple filed another lawsuit against the chip maker's business practices in China, Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf sought to assuage Apple during yesterday's earnings call, saying that the company intends \"to remain a good supplier to Apple, even while this dispute continues, and [we] believe that there is no better long-term partner to Apple than Qualcomm.\" Thereafter, he launched into a frontal attack on the iPhone maker, claiming that it \"instigated\" the FTC's recent complaints against Qualcomm.

It is certainly not doing this for the money. While a billion dollars may seem like a large amount to most, it is trifling change by the standards of a company that reported $237.6 billion in cash reserves last quarter. Apple's case is also not about gaining an upper hand in its business relationship with Qualcomm. Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. (SSNLF) and Apple together account for 50% of the San Diego-based chip maker's revenues. That should give Apple sufficient bargaining power in its negotiations with Qualcomm, especially since the exclusivity agreement it signed with the chip maker expired in 2015. (See also: Is Qualcomm's Royalty Revenue at Risk?)\n\nLikely, Apple's displeasure with Qualcomm is rooted less in the company's business practices and more in a business strategy that eventually envisages its own baseband chips. In recent times, Apple has added Intel Corporation (INTC) to its list of suppliers for baseband chips. However, Intel's chips do not work on CDMA networks, such as those run by Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ). That may not be such a big drawback for Apple, since it is already planning to expand into markets, such as India, where CDMA is already dead.

It has actively poached key personnel from Intel and Qualcomm. According to an article in Fast Company magazine, Apple may have future plans to design a system on a chip (SoC), which would be fabricated at an Intel plant and help Apple manage increased design complexity for its phones. The SoC would help Apple cut costs and chip complexity for iPhone manufacturing as it expands in foreign markets with multiple wireless carriers. \"Apple's goal is to spend less money on things like modems that are invisible to customers, and more money on things like the display that users are constantly aware of,\" the article's author writes.
