After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?\n\n\n\nApple Inc. AAPL stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:\n\n\n\nPE Ratio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we focus on the long-term PE trend, Apple’s current PE level puts it slightly above its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.
