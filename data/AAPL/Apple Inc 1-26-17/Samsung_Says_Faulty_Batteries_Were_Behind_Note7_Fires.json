{"body": "Consumer electronics giant Samsung (SSNLF) has completed its four-month investigation to determine the root cause of the faulty Galaxy Note 7 phones that caught fire.\n\nOn Monday, the South Korean conglomerate concluded that the defect was due to two separate sets of faulty batteries and that the fires were not caused by hardware or software. The company released its findings at a press conference after testing more than 200,000 phones. Chief executive DJ Koh apologized to customers and in a statement said, “Today, more than ever, we are committed to earning the trust of our customers through innovation that redefines what is possible in safety, and as a gateway to unlimited possibilities and incredible new experiences.”\n\nThe company also announced new and enhanced safety measures, including an 8-Point Battery Safety Check protocol and a battery advisor group of external advisers. In a detailed image (posted below) posted on its website, Samsung outlined every aspect of what went wrong in the Galaxy Note7. It said independent organizations arrived at the same conclusion.\n\nSince it seems suspicious that two separate battery suppliers failed, the company clarified to Recode that Samsung did not make unreasonable demands of its suppliers and the design of the Note7 was not the root cause of the trouble. The company did not mention its suppliers by name in the press release, but they were previously identified as Samsung SDI Co Ltd and China's Amperex Technology Ltd, reported Reuters.\n\nEarlier this month, Samsung issued fourth quarter forecast, saying it expects operating profits to rise almost 50%, blowing past consensus estimates, thanks to its components business, which offset declines in its mobile unit. The components business supplies memory chips and display panels to other companies, including rival Apple, Inc. (AAPL). But Samsung did not escape the battery issue completely unscathed. The company said it may delay the unveiling of the Galaxy S8, originally planned to be shown next month at the Mobile World Congress, to ensure the product isn't prone to defects.\n\nOne of the independent experts to conduct its own investigation was UL, a global independent safety science company. In phase one of the investigation, which tore down 10 damaged Note 7 devices with a specific set of batteries to understand the failure mechanism and causes of failure, UL discovered signs of internal short circuit (ISC) at the upper right corner of the cells from 6 damaged devices (see image below). UL also pointed to signs of ISC at the upper right corner of 4 swollen cells.\n\nIn the second phase, UL conducted CT scan of 30 cells and disassembly of 20 cells and found only minor anomalies such as small void/bubble or uneven stress. UL used samples that show a similar pattern of deformation at upper corners. Upper right corner deformation appears to be deeper than upper left, UL says. Tear down analysis also shows repeating deformation areas on separator at the corner locations (see image below).\n\nGiven the extent to which Samsung has gone to solicit the help of independent experts, the world's largest smartphone maker was serious about not only finding the cause of the defect, but also ensuring that consumers trust the process was handled both thoroughly and objectively.\n\nUnimpressed by the result, the Wall Street Journal said, “After its two Note 7 recalls, Samsung’s work on re-establishing trust with consumers and bringing changes to the industry is still incomplete.” The WSJ noted Samsung deserves a “C grade” for its explanation, saying “That’s like a meteor striking your house—twice.”", "category": "Apple Inc 1-26-17", "title": "Samsung Says Faulty Batteries Were Behind Note7 Fires"}
