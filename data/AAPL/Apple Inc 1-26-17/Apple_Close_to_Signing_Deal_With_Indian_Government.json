(AAPL) executives were in India today to discuss expanding the company's operations in the country with government officials, and it sounds like it was worth the trip.\n\nIn a statement the company said, \"We've been working hard to develop our operations in India. We appreciate the constructive and open dialogue we've had with government about further expanding our local operations.\"\n\nAn official speaking to the Wall Street Journal said, \"it's almost a done deal\" and that Apple is requesting tax and tariff exemptions, which the official called \"workable.\"\n\nThe tech giant is looking to manufacture in India and it was reported yesterday that it has picked Wistron Corp to be its first manufacturer in the region. Apple also said in June that it plans to open retail stores in the country.\n\nIndia is the world’s second largest smartphone market and Apple currently controls only 2% of it. Apple iPhones are exorbitantly priced in India due to customs duties levied against imported products. The Indian government has also denied Apple permission to sell refurbished phones in the country. Most tech brands successful in India, like Samsung or Lenovo, manufacture their goods locally.
