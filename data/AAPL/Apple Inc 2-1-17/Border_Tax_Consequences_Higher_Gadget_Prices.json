{"body": "Will your favorite tech gadget become more expensive under the new presidential administration?\n\nThat prospect seems to be a distinct possibility with President Trump's proposed border adjustment tax. The measure, which would impose a punitive 20% tax rate on imported products, could inflate prices for popular tech devices because the vast majority of them are imported from Asian manufacturing operations.\n\nAccording to some estimates, the cost of Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) iPhone could rise by between $30 and $40 if its components were shipped to the U.S. for assembly. The smartphone's manufacturing costs could rise an additional $80 to $90 if its components were manufactured in the U.S. Similar price increases would impact other popular tech devices. This is because most technology companies have either set up their own manufacturing operations or partner with local companies in Asia.

Similarly, Alphabet Inc. subsidiary Google's (GOOGL) manufacturing partner for Pixel phones is Taiwanese manufacturer HTC Corporation (2498.TW). Amazon.com, Inc.'s (AMZN) best-selling Kindle devices are also made in China.

First, it enables cheaper labor costs, Second, it provides access to a dynamic supply chain ecosystem that Apple CEO Tim Cook said \"surpassed what's in the U.S.\" Dismantling their operations in Asia could come with severe business costs for technology companies. With Asian markets, such as China, accounting for a major chunk of the bottom line for some U.S. tech companies, they have added incentives not to move their operations back home.\n\nA strong dollar could potentially offset the impact of a border adjustment tax by making imports cheaper. According to investment bank The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS), the greenback would need to appreciate by 25% in order to make up for firms' lost revenue. However, consensus around the strong dollar theory is divided.

The special editions would cost between $100 to $200 more, he said. However, he added that the \"net net of repatriation and border tax will be a net negative for Apple.\" (See also: How Trump's Tax Plan Is Dividing Corporate America.)", "category": "Apple Inc 2-1-17", "title": "Border Tax Consequences: Higher Gadget Prices"}
