{"body": "Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook says his company had no choice but to file a lawsuit against Qualcomm (QCOM) because the mobile chipmaker was overstepping its legal bounds.\n\nOn his earnings conference call with analysts late Tuesday, Cook discussed why Apple is taking its supplier to court.\n\n\"I don't like litigation and view it as a last resort,\" Cook said. \"And so you should take from our filing that we viewed it as we didn't see another way forward.\"\n\nApple filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm in U.S. federal district court on Jan. 20, alleging that Qualcomm demanded onerous terms for its technology and sought to punish Apple for cooperating in a government antitrust probe.\n\nApple said Qualcomm has withheld $1 billion in rebate payments to Apple as retribution for the iPhone maker's participation in an investigation by South Korea's antitrust regulator.\n\nIBD'S TAKE: Qualcomm stock has a mediocre IBD Composite Rating of 49.
