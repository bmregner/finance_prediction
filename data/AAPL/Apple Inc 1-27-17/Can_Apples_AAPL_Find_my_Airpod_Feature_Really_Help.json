{"body": "On Tuesday Apple Inc. (AAPL) announced its iOS 10.3 update with a special feature, apparently called “Find my Airpods”, that will help to track misplaced Airpods.\n\nPowered by a new W1 chip, the Airpods are in line with Apple’s vision of wireless future. Apparently, its best feature seems to be the use of sensors to detect if the plugs have been inserted in both the ears. However, since its launch, Airpod has been a hot topic of discussion on Facebook FB and Twitter TWTR given the chances of it being misplaced easily due to its size.\n\nPer media reports, Apple’s announcement can be seen as an answer to users’ request to make a feature that will help them find these small AirPods. Due to its small size, the Airpod cannot accommodate a built-in GPS system. Therefore, the latest feature is tailored to locate misplaced Airpods that are within the Bluetooth range of an iPhone or iPad.\n\nThen again, the problem remains that the exact location of the Airpod cannot be determined with the feature and only the last connected location will show up on the connected iOS device, add further media reports. Additionally, the feature is capable of activating a sound from the Airpod to indicate its location. However, these features are useless once the Airpod’s battery is exhausted.\n\nApple Inc. Price and Consensus | Apple Inc. Quote\n\nApple’s fortunes have been tied to its most important offering, the iPhone, which alone contributed about 60% of its total revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.\n\nHowever, since the last two quarters, the demand for this device has been soft owing to global macroeconomic weakness, especially due to currency volatility and declining commodity prices in some key regions across the globe (about 60% of Apple revenues come from International markets).\n\nThe Airpod had been one of the key attractions of the iPhone 7 series. Reportedly, since the launch of Airpods in December, Apple has been on the top of the headphone market that boasts names likes Sony SNE, Bose, JBL and others. Although Apple has refrained from posting its official sales figures, the market reports indicate positive impact of Airpod sales on first quarter results.\n\nIn the past one year, Apple’s shares are up 19.98%, compared with the Zacks Computer Mini industry’s increase of 21.41%, as of Jan 24.", "category": "Apple Inc 1-27-17", "title": "Can Apple's (AAPL) \"Find my Airpod\" Feature Really Help?"}
