{"body": "Apple reported earnings today for the all-important holiday quarter of 2016, with a clean beat on the top and bottom lines.\n\nBut according to Apple's quarterly report, Apple shipped about 13 million iPads, which is down 19% from the same period in 2015. Revenue from the iPad business is down 22% year-on-year to $5.5 million, too.\n\nThat's not an encouraging result for the biggest gift-giving time of the year, and it just continues the steady decline of the iPad business.\n\nIn 2016, Apple introduced a new model of iPad, too, with the 9.7\" iPad Pro — a device designed to be used with a keyboard, intended to be somewhere between a tablet and a laptop, similar to Microsoft's Surface computers.

It means there's unlikely to be a huge rush to buy any new models.\n\nIt's possible there's light at the end of the tunnel, however: Apple is reported to be working on a total iPad redesign, to launch as soon as this year, which could maybe spur a big upgrade cycle.\n\nJoin the conversation about this story »\n\nNOW WATCH: iPhone users will want this new screen display feature of the iPad Pro\n\nSEE ALSO: Microsoft's CEO takes a shot at Tim Cook over the iPad Pro's similarities to the Surface", "category": "Apple Inc 1-31-17", "title": "Apple's iPad business is experiencing major shrinkage (AAPL)"}
