{"body": "Shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL) are rising about 3% in the after-hour session Tuesday, reaching a session high of $124.20 after the Cupertino-based iPhone maker reported its fiscal 2017 first quarter earnings results that not only beat Wall Street estimates on earnings per share and revenue, Apple also topped analysts’ forecasts for iPhone unit shipments.\n\n“We sold more iPhones than ever before and set all-time revenue records for iPhone, Services, Mac and Apple Watch,” said CEO Tim Cook in a statement.\n\nApple’s iPhone 7 has been promoted aggressively by wireless carriers, who were looking to offset loss sales from Samsung’s (SSNLF) massive recall due to exploding Galaxy Note batteries. Given the solid guidance Apple issued for fiscal 2017, it would seem Apple, which grew device market share over Samsung in the last three months of 2016, expects to sustain its lead for a few more quarters.\n\nLet’s go through the numbers.\n\nFor the three months that ended December, Apple earned a net income of $7.8 billion, or $3.36 per share. Although that marks a slight rise of 2.4% year over year, it translates to a 14-cent beat, according to Thomson Reuters. First quarter revenue came in at $78.04 billion, up 3.3% year over year, topping estimates by more than $1 billion. The strength in iPhone sales was a big question mark. Apple said it sold 78 million iPhones, up from 75 million sold in last year’s holiday quarter. Analyst were looking or 77 million units. This quarter was more than an iPhone story, however.\n\n“Revenue from Services grew strongly over last year, led by record customer activity on the App Store, and we are very excited about the products in our pipeline,” Cook boasted.\n\nServices revenue, which includes Apple Music, the App Store, iCloud, Apple Care and Apple Pay, grew 17.5% year over year to $7.17 billion, also topping forecasts of $6.91 billion. Services has quickly become Apple's second-largest business segment. Apple still has a long way to go to lessen its reliance of iPhone sales. But the company appears better balanced from the year-ago quarter.\n\nLooking ahead, for the second quarter, ending in March, Apple expects revenue between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion, compared to consensus estimates of $53.94 billion. The company expects gross margin to be between 38% and 39%. Notably, this is the firs time in several quarters that Apple’s gross margin forecast — typically at 38.5% on the high-end range — has approached 39%. That’s something to keep an eye on.\n\nApple said it returned nearly $15 billion to investors through a combination of buybacks and dividends during the quarter, which now brings its capital return program payments total to over $200 billion. The market was pricing in about a 4% move in Apple stock (in either direction) by the end of the week. With an strong results across the board Tuesday, Apple, which had risen almost 20% since the mid-November, dictated the course.\n\nAs such, I’m placing a fifteen multiple on fiscal 2017 estimates of $8.93 per share and expect Apple stock to reach an all-time high to $135 by the end of the year, delivering 12% returns. And that’s excellent value when combined with its 2.00% dividend yield and its massive cash stockpile that helps investors sleep well at night.", "category": "Apple Inc 1-31-17", "title": "Apple (AAPL) Crushes Q1 Earnings; Revenue, iPhone, Services Beat"}
