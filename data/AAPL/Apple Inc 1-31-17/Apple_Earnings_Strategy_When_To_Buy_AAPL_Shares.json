{"body": "Apple (AAPL) will release their earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017 next Tuesday, and the guessing game has begun. It used to be that analysts would wait until they had seen the numbers before opining or changing any rating on Apple stock. In part that was because up until last year, the company continually made those analysts look foolish by beating every quarter’s estimates by huge margins.\n\nThat meant that investors who bought the stock in the run up to earnings invariably benefited, and analysts would rush to upgrade forecasts once the extent of the beat was known. However, the recent slowdown in growth has changed the dynamic somewhat.\n\nNow it seems that the competition among those that cover AAPL is to see who can come out with the gloomiest earnings prediction, and who can downgrade the earliest. Over the past week two big names, Barclays and Stifel have downgraded AAPL in front of earnings, both citing worries about i-Phone 7 sales.\n\nThis kind of focus on potential and actual negatives surrounding Apple’s earnings has changed the way retail investors should approach the release too. With such negativity abounding the stock is likely to lose ground as earnings approach, and/or to react to anything but a spectacular report in a negative, or at best muted, manner.\n\nFar from buying in front of the release, then, waiting until afterwards makes sense this time around. That assumes that buying AAPL at all would be a good idea; an assumption not everybody will be comfortable with. The negative slant to coverage that makes it likely that you will be able to pick up AAPL cheap next week will also put off some people, but a look at the facts and prospects should reassure you.\n\nFirst, let’s look at the stock’s actual performance. If you listen to the naysayers they would have you believe that AAPL has underperformed recently. The reality, though, as demonstrated by the chart below comparing AAPL to the Nasdaq tracking ETF, QQQ over the last six months, is completely different. During that time AAPL has outperformed its benchmark by a factor of 3, gaining 24% compared to the index’s 8%.\n\nAppreciation in AAPL though, as with any stock, is about what will happen in the future rather than what has happened in the past, but there are a few reasons to be optimistic on that front too. As I wrote a few weeks ago, my personal experience suggests that demand for the Apple Watch series 2 is greater than anybody expected, with a fair amount of pent up demand resulting from widespread shortages of the product in the holiday buying season.\n\nIn addition, even those anticipating lower than expected iPhone sales have noted that the higher priced 7 Plus has proven more popular than expected, which should benefit the bottom line.\n\nAll of that is positive, but what investors are really looking for is for Apple to do something spectacular again in order to re-invigorate the whole ecosystem. Their recent decision to start commissioning original content for Apple TV offers the possibility of that. Content production is, of course, a very crowded field right now, and a difficult business at the best of times, but Apple has a huge advantage over others that might try to break into the market: over $200 billion in cash.\n\nAs Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN) have shown, it only takes one or two hits to be successful in this area and with the ability to absorb a few failures, betting against Apple succeeding would seem to be foolish.\n\nAdd in a decent and growing dividend and buying or adding to holdings of AAPL is a good idea. With that said, though, the fact that the conventional wisdom seems to be that this will be a disappointing earnings release for the company makes patience in this case a virtue, and waiting until after next Tuesday’s report is a risk that should pay off.", "category": "Apple Inc 1-31-17", "title": "Apple Earnings Strategy: When To Buy AAPL Shares"}
