{"body": "In 2010, analysts said that the smartphone trend was going to make Silicon Valley investors rich.\n\nIt was a savvy bet. Between 2010 and 2015 the number of smartphone users in the U.S. tripled, jumping from 62.6 million to 189 million.\n\nToday, smartphone growth is dwindling, and tech industry giants are looking for the next big thing. Or maybe they've already found it.\n\n[See: 9 Ways to Invest in a Post-Election Market.]\n\nAnalysts now think the growth has shifted from smartphones to smart homes. Statista, a German database company, estimates that the number of connected households will nearly triple from 31.6 million in 2016 to 80.4 million in 2021.\n\nThe usual suspects are all frothing at the mouth to seize this opportunity. Alphabet's (ticker: GOOG, GOOGL) Google, Amazon.com ( AMZN), and Apple ( AAPL) are virtually at each other's throats trying to cash in.\n\nGoogle. Google began building its smart home systems in earnest in 2014, when it bought smart thermostat company Nest for $3.2 billion.\n\nUnfortunately, Nest hasn't spread its wings yet. In 2014, Nest had a \"smart thermostat\" and \"smart smoke alarm.\" Three years later, it offers only two additional products: indoor and outdoor cameras.\n\nFor a company that was supposed to help \"innovate upon devices in the home, making them more useful, intuitive, and thoughtful,\" as GOOG stated in its 2014 10-K, Nest has been a flop.\n\nOn the brighter side, Google Home, released in October 2016, is GOOG's wireless, voice-activated speaker loaded with an AI-powered virtual assistant. It can play music, answer questions about weather and traffic, set alarms, and control other compatible smart devices. While Google Home arrived a full two years after the Amazon Echo, there are some upsides.\n\n\"Google has an advantage with a more sophisticated AI layer, which will certainly be important and could help them ultimately win\" the smart home battle, says Don DeLoach, Infobright president and CEO.\n\nThat AI layer, dubbed the Google Assistant, is informed by Google's unparalleled ability to access search data and understand the user.\n\nAmazon. The Amazon Echo is essentially a Google Home -- except it was released two years earlier, and has been collecting user data and improving its Alexa AI continuously over that time. This first-mover advantage, constant improvement and the best online retail real estate in the U.S. (i.e. the front page of Amazon.com) helped make Alexa devices the best-selling smart home devices in the market.\n\nOver the holiday season, sales of the Amazon Echo family were up more than 800 percent from the year before. Millions of Alexa devices have been sold worldwide, and the Echo Dot was the single best-selling item on all of Amazon, making AMZN the best smart home stock as it stands today.\n\nBut first-mover advantage isn't the only reason AMZN is leading the way in the smart home revolution.\n\nExpanding the audience to include the developer \"is where Amazon has an edge on its competitors,\" says Chris Stone, chief products officer at Acquia, the digital experience company.\n\n\"In November, Amazon launched its own cloud computing service, Lex, opening up Alexa's technology to any developer, organization, or application,\" Stone says. \"Going forward, consumers will get tired of weather reports, turning on lights, ordering an Uber and listening to playlists from a cylindrical device, and the company that prioritizes integration will come out on top.\"\n\n[See: 5 Things Everyone Should Know About Dow 20,000.]\n\nAMZN also offers the Amazon Dash, a branded button you order, keep in your home and press any time you run out of a common consumer good. Colgate, Tide, Trojan and Bounty are a few of the many brands offering Amazon Dash buttons.\n\nApple. AAPL doesn't even make smart home devices, but it has focused on the software side of the smart home; its Home app serves as a controller for all smart devices compliant with Apple's HomeKit software. Through Siri, or with your Apple TV, you can control lights and garage doors, lock your house or raise the blinds -- as long as you own the connected devices.\n\nOne major difference between Apple and both GOOG and AMZN is that Homekit device-to-device communication is encrypted, so Apple has no idea what requests you make or how you use your home of the future.", "category": "Apple Inc 1-31-17", "title": "Which Stocks Will Win the Smart Home Revolution?
