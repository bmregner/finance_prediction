{"body": "Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) reports Q4 earnings on 02/01 AMC. MKM partners remain positive on the fundamentals, but believe that sentiment challenges might linger into mid-year. Anecdotes from online ad channels remain positive and MKM des not think GOOGL results of only in-line Websites revenue necessarily suggest that FB will not deliver upside.\n\nMKM thinks expense growth guidance could be above the 43% implied in consensus, MKM is guessing 45% to 55%. Any color on the impact of ad loads on growth would be helpful to frame likely 2H deceleration and a positive. While forward 12-month P/E has rebounded from the lows of 21.5x to 25x currently, MKM thinks comfort on 2H and 2018 estimates would drive a more sustainable recovery in the multiple.\n\nReads from online ad channels are positive for Q4 and expectations are for upside to consensus ad revenue of $8.3Bn. Consensus implies growth of 47%, a sharp deceleration from 59% in Q3. GOOGL was only in-line with total advertising revenue up 17% (similar to the 18% growth last quarter), an increase of $3.3Bn y/y. Consensus looks for FB to increase ad revenue by $2.7Bn y/y. This is a smaller proportion of incremental ad spend vs. GOOGL than in Q3 (i.e. any cautious read from GOOGL results might be misleading).\n\nWhile not yet providing specific expense commentary, management has repeatedly warned that 2017 will be an investment year and plans to accelerate recruiting and capital expenses. 45% to 55% is the same initial range offered for 2016 and would represent an incremental $5.2Bn to $6.4Bn of spending in 2017. Actual expense growth for 2016 will likely come in the 46-47% range, an incremental $3.7Bn over 2015. In each of the prior two years, cash expense growth also came in well below the midpoint of initial guidance. 2015 started at 50% to 70% growth, with the actual at 51%. In 2014, initial guidance was 40% to 45% while the actual was 34%.\n\nManagement has repeatedly warned to expect revenue growth to “come down meaningfully” by mid-2017 when they restrict ad load increases. There has been no guidance on how much ad load has driven growth or how much deceleration to expect. Providing additional granularity (or full year revenue guidance) could remove much uncertainty. MKM is not expecting additional color. MKM thinks management is highly focused on long-term value for shareholders, but not so much about near-term investor skittishness.", "category": "Facebook 1-30-17", "title": "Facebook Inc (FB): Expect Strong Q4 Results on Wednesday"}
