Facebook (FB) reported that introduction of a Security Key system for its two-factor authentication method while logging in to the social media site. In this Security Key 2FA process, Facebook also introduced NFC-based logins for its mobile site – a first of its kind for any social site.\n\nThe social networking giant currently offers 2FA via a security code for login approvals from a text message (SMS) or by using the Facebook app to generate the code directly on their phone. Now, Facebook has introduced a new security key system that can transmit data via NFC to help log into the social media site through a physical key. This means that NFC-embedded Android devices can now use NFC-capable keys (like Yubico’s) to log into Facebook’s mobile site.\n\nThe security key system, even though a great step forward, is still in its nascent beginnings. First up, it won’t work on your app, and is only compatible with the mobile site on the latest version of the Chrome browser. Furthermore, you will also need the latest version of the Google Authenticator installed on your Android device to make this 2FA process work.\n\nCan Facebook, Inc. make its way to investors watch list? Find Out Here\n\nShares of Enbridge Inc.
