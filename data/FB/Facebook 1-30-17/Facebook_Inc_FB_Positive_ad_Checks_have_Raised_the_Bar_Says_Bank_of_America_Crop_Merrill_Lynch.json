{"body": "Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) reports on 2/1. Bank of America Merrill Lynch is slightly above the Street on EPS and sees upside potential for 4Q to beat on strong user engagement, demand for newer ad formats (dynamic product ads, video), and ramping Instagram monetization. The research firm's recent checks suggest a robust ad demand environment (tempered somewhat by Google’s in-line Website growth) and, overall, BAML believes the buyside could be looking for around ~50% ex-FX y/y ad revenue growth (2-yr acceleration), and BAML thinks FB can meet expectations.\n\nBAML has been somewhat surprised by +15% YTD performance, as Facebook faces sentiment headwinds including: 1) ad load growth slowdown mid-‘17; 2) potential margin pressure in ‘17; and 3) potential Snap IPO in early ‘17. In addition, the Trump administration adds immigration (H-1B visas) and net neutrality risk.  However, some ad checks (Kenshoo, Merkle) have suggested social spend accelerated in 4Q, which has raised optimism on positive estimate revisions despite higher investment spend.\n\nBAML's 4Q revenue estimate at $8.5bn is in-line with the Street, while its EPS is slightly above ($1.35 vs $1.31). BAML's 2017 revenue estimate of $36.7bn is also in-line, with its $5.34 EPS estimate above the Street’s $5.23. BAML estimates 41% non-GAAP expense growth (Street around 40%), and thinks management could guide to 45-55% on the call. BAML thinks the Street is looking for revenue upside to offset spending growth.\n\nHigher expectations add risk to the reaction on results, and with the stock above $130, BAML expects management to continue to temper expectations. However, BAML likes what it is hearing from advertisers and new topline drivers are already emerging (Instagram Stories ads, video mid-rolls, FAN expansion), which could help offset ad load slowdown in 2H. BAML reiterates its Buy rating as the core story is solid and the firm thinks the stock could hold a forward P/E at 20-24x and benefit from 20%+ EPS growth.\n\nThe companies mentioned in this article are subjects of research reports issued recently by investment firms.
