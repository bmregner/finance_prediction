{"body": "Getting through a bad breakup can be pretty rough.\n\nHowever, Catherine Blackett, a 22-year-old from Derbyshire, England, recently suffered more than just a broken heart when things ended with her boyfriend.\n\nBlackett’s ex, 42-year-old Thomas Raven, left her with an empty heart… and an even emptier wallet.\n\nApparently, Blackett’s ex-boyfriend stole over $3,750 from her and even opened up fraudulent credit cards in her name.\n\nIn an attempt to stop Raven from doing this again, Blackett turned to Facebook to warn other women about her “fraud boyfriend.”\n\nShe posted two pictures of Raven, along with a caption detailing her experience with him.\n\nIn the post, she reveals the scam artist’s true identity:\n\nI just want to make you all aware of this man. His name is Thomas Raven (Aka Paul Slaney). Paul is his birth name but legally changed it to Tom (which was his acting name). He still uses both names when it benefits him. DOB 26.03.74 he has been known for lying to women about his age.\n\nThen she dives into the ugly details,\n\nHe goes for women of all ages, he tends to pick out the vulnerable ones so he can easily manipulate them. He will wine and dine you, buy you flowers, tell you everything you want to hear. He’ll promise you the world… But things will change. I hate to say it but I am one of many who have fallen into his trap. He will bleed you dry of your money as he has with myself and other ex’s.\n\nBlackett reveals Raven spent, “over £3K on my credit card without me knowing on furniture for his house, presents for myself and his children and more.”\n\nBut that’s not all.\n\nAccording to Blackett, “Two months after I walked away from him, I found out he fraudulently opened two store cards in my name, making himself an additional card holder using his birth name. He worked up a debt which then left me with bad credit and the companies chasing me for the money.”\n\nAt the end of the post, she writes, “I know posting this won’t benefit me, I’ve already lost my fight with him but I hate the thought of him doing it to yet another women and getting away with it again.”\n\nIt turns out that Blackett isn’t the only woman who’s been burned by this terrible man.\n\nBlackett decided to take things a step further by exposing this fraudster in the Sunday Mirror, too.\n\nRaven responded to Blackett’s allegations, stating, “I am not a bad person. She’s just bitter and it all spiralled out of control.”\n\nHowever, based on Blackett’s Facebook post, it appears that Raven has a long list of outspoken ex girlfriends who think otherwise.\n\nFor more Elite Daily original videos, subscribe to the official Elite Daily YouTube Channel and like the official Elite Daily Facebook Page.", "category": "Facebook 1-30-17", "title": "Woman FB Shames 'Fraud' BF Who Stole $3K, Gets Replies From All His Exes"}
