{"body": "Hollywood actor, Kal Penn, has raised over $160,000 in funds for Syrian refugees after an Instagram user posted this vile comment on his post: \"You don’t belong in this country you f***ing joke\".\n\nOn his fundraising page, he wrote,\n\n\"We are better than the hateful people who tell us we don't belong in our own country, that America can't be a beacon of freedom and hope for refugees from around the world. We will turn their bigotry, along with the President's, into love.\"\n\nHe took home a glittering trophy and a cash prize of Rs 40 Lakhs. Now, a very amazing thing happened. Moments after winning the coveted prize, Manveer’s father announced that they would be donating fifty percent of the prize to Salman Khan’s charity organization Being Human at the event! Now, that’s something, isn’t it?\n\nPopular singer of the 90s, Abhijeet is notorious for passing tasteless comments about anything and everything. From tweeting about Salman Khan’s innocence to taking disgusting digs at Pakistan, the man has done it all.\n\nHe couldn’t resist himself from commenting on the burning issue. Instead of sympathizing, the singer passed some very shameful and cheap comments! In his tweets, he said that the film industry is run by “chakkas and gays”. Furthermore, he claimed that Bollywood is an Anti-Hindu industry.\n\nSena has now released three demands for Bhansali. First, there should be no intimate scenes in the movie between the characters of Rani Padmavati and Alauddin Khilji. Second, no historical facts should be distorted while making the movie. Third, the Karni Sena should be allowed to review the movie before its release.\n\nHe took to Facebook to write a long post on the whole SLB’s Padmavati row. It reads,“I have been taught to engage and question those that govern us and I have been doing that since I was a student and V.P. Singh was the PM, followed by Congress and now BJP. I have been taught that your PM is the head of the state or country, who you can question, seek answers, argue with, but never fear him, because you chose him and he represents your well being. “If one has to fear him than that’s sad. Respect cannot be demanded it’s commanded. It’s earned. It does not deter me from asking and engaging.”", "category": "Facebook 1-30-17", "title": "Anurag Kashyap's Strong FB Post, Manveer's Generous Donation To Charity & More From Ent"}
