{"body": "U.S. stock futures are pulling back this morning, as President Donald Trump’s travel ban on immigrants from several predominantly Muslim countries cast doubts on further economic policies. The uncertainty has placed the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s tentative hold on 20,000 in question amid a flood of key corporate earnings this week.\n\nHeading into the open, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are off 0.3%, while S&P 500 futures have dropped 0.34% and Nasdaq-100 futures have fallen 0.35%.\n\nOn the options front, volume arrived below average on Friday, as about 14.4 million calls and 13.6 million puts crossed the tape. Over on the CBOE, puts gained traction ahead of the weekend, as the single-session equity put/call volume ratio jumped to a one-month high of 0.73, forcing the 10-day moving average to tick higher to 0.66.\n\nTurning to Friday’s volume leaders, earnings was the major driver for several large tech names on the top ten most active options listing.
