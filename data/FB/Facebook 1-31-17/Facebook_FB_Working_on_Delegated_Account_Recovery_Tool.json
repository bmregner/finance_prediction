{"body": "In a blog post yesterday, Facebook Inc. FB security engineer Brad Hill said that the social media giant is working on tightening account security and is testing new account recovery means that will considerably eliminate the importance of email and SMS.\n\nGenerally, when a user tries to reset account password, apart from the \"risky\" security questions, the other \"best alternatives\" are recovery emails and SMSes, which according to Hill are \"showing their age\". He adds that these do not provide \"end to end security\" assurance like most \"modern protocols\", and as a result their reliability is now being questioned. Numerous email hacking incidents, such as the one at Yahoo, has put a question mark on the viability of recovery emails as best alternatives for account recovery.\n\nTherefore, in order to improve account security, Facebook is now launching the \"delegated account recovery\" feature for third party sites like GitHub. Per the post, to use the tool, a user needs to first set up a recovery token in \"advance\" with his Facebook account. Just in case, if the user loses details of their GitHub account, they can \"re-authenticate\" to Facebook, which will then \"send the token back to GitHub with a time-stamped counter-signature.\" The token is encrypted so that no one can access the stored information. The token can assure third party websites that the same user who created the token is receiving it.\n\nFacebook, Inc. Price | Facebook, Inc. Quote\n\nHill added that the feature will be rolled out in a \"limited fashion with GitHub\". The feature is being released as an open source enabling other websites to implement as well allow security researchers to point out the glitches. It is a part of Facebook's \"bug bounty program\".\n\nAt present, Facebook has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
