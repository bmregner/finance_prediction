{"body": "President Trump's first week in office was full of brash, top-down decisions and executive orders, many of which have proven extraordinarily controversial among American citizens. One of the most problematic of these decrees has been his immigration moratorium, commonly referred to as a \"Muslim ban\" because of the countries that it targets and their predominantly Muslim populations. Banning immigrants from these countries is a promise Trump made on his campaign trail, but the action will not be without political consequences. In a CNBC report, a consortium of companies including Google, Netflix, and Airbnb will meet in the days to come to discuss legal action that they can pursue collectively against the new ban. Here is what some of the leading figures in the tech industry have said about Trump's order.\n\nTim Cook, the CEO of Apple Inc. (AAPL), emailed his company staff regarding the order. The message, first published by Buzzfeed, reiterates Apple's belief in the importance of immigration. In fact, he says \"Apple would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do.\" The policy is not one that his company supports, he indicated.\n\nFacebook Inc. (FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg expressed his personal feelings about the ban, saying via Facebook post that his \"great grandparents came from Germany, Austria and Poland,\" and that his wife's parents were refugees as well. Zuckerberg was challenged of the ban, saying he was \"concerned about the impact\" of such a policy and that he felt that, while national security is a priority, \"we should do that by focusing on people who actually pose a threat\" and not on a broad swath of people from one religious group.\n\nTwitter Inc.'s (TWTR) CEO, Jack Dorsey, posted numerous tweets on his personal account throughout the weekend of the ban. He described Trump's actions as causing an economic impact that will be \"real and upsetting.\" Twitter itself issued a company-wide response, saying that the business is \"built by immigrants of all religions. We stand for and with them, always.\"\n\nBrian Chesky, founder of Airbnb, tweeted his company's support of refugees left without immigration options in the wake of the ban. He offered that \"Airbnb is providing free housing to refugees and anyone not allowed in the U.S.\"\n\nJeff Bezos, leader of ecommerce giant Amazon.com Inc, (AMZN), is preparing to mount a legal battle against the executive order ban. In a report published by Telegraph, the entrepreneur said that the order was one \"we do not support...we're a nation of immigrants whose diverse backgrounds, ideas and points of view have helped us build and invent as a nation for over 240 years.\"\n\nLyft's CEO bashed Trump for the ban and pledged $1 million in donations to the ACLU. At the same time, thousands of Uber users deleted their accounts in response to the company's links to the Trump administration.", "category": "Facebook 1-31-17", "title": "Cook, Zuckerberg, Bezos: Tech CEOs on Trump's Immigration Order"}
