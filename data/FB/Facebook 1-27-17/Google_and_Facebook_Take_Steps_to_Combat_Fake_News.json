{"body": "Alphabet Inc. subsidiary Google (GOOG) and Facebook, Inc. (FB) are taking further steps to crack down on fake news.\n\nGoogle banned 200 publishers from its AdSense Network in 2016, and a number of those publishers were fake news websites. The company made this revelation in its Bad Ads report, which is released at the beginning of each year. Fake news sites typically lure viewers into their orbit with an internet address similar to that of a news website. Google refers to these ads as \"tabloid cloaking\" ads, or ads for publications that peddle fake facts. \"During a single sweep for tabloid cloaking in December 2016, we took down 22 cloakers that were responsible for ads seen more than 20 million times by people online in a single week,\" Google wrote in the report.

For example, a search for \"Final Election Count\" led the search engine's users to a fake news website that claimed victory for Donald Trump in the popular vote. In reality, Donald Trump lost the popular vote by 2.8 million votes to Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton.

It stated that it would display headlines from a publisher's article and the name of the publisher in that section. It would also determine trending news topics based on engagement and the number of publishers generating content about that topic.\n\nThe Menlo Park, Calif.-based company has already announced plans to use artificial intelligence to tackle the fake news problem. Along with Google, Facebook has also promised to stop ad dollars from flowing to such sites. However, Facebook's CEO cautioned in an interview that the company should be wary of becoming \"arbiters of truth ourselves.\" (See also: Facebook Is Using AI to Tackle Fake News.)", "category": "Facebook 1-27-17", "title": "Google and Facebook Take Steps to Combat Fake News"}
