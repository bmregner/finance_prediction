Nagar, looking for help. Nirmala Rajesh, an employee of a private firm, was returning home from work when her scooter ran out of fuel.\n\nWhen Mr. Narayana asked if she needed help, Ms. Rajesh explained the situation and told him that she was waiting for her husband. The traffic policeman offered his scooter and asked Ms. Rajesh to go to Mekhri Circle and wait for him there, as it was well-lit area and safe. Meanwhile, he pushed the scooter till the circle, which was nearly half-a-km away. By then, Ms. Rajesh’s husband reached the spot with petrol, and the couple thanked Mr. Narayana before heading home.\n\nThe incident went viral after Ms. Rajesh posted her account on social media. She said: “Mr. Narayan has set another example that police are polite and friendly too....” Hundreds of people commented and appreciated the good work, prompting senior officials to applaud Mr. Narayana.
