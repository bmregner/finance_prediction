{"body": "Pacific Crest expects solid Q4 results and believes the likelihood for cautious commentary on ad load and conservative expense guidance are captured in current expectations. The firm sees the potential for upside to 2017 expectations from improved pricing, growth in video, or a stabilized hiring rate.\n\n2017 expectations appear reasonable despite ad load and expense concerns. Pacific Crest expects Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) to once again highlight slowing ad load growth and foreign exchange as headwinds to 2017 revenue growth, but believe these can be offset by growth in users, pricing and video engagement. Initial guidance for 2017 expenses may be at the high end of expectations, but has historically been conservative. Based on hiring patterns, Pacific Crest does not expect expense growth to exceed current expectations. Video is likely key to 2017; the firm does not expect messaging monetization. The research firm expects Facebook to develop a broader set of tools for businesses to use Messenger and WhatsApp in 2017, but do not expect significant monetization efforts to begin this year. In contrast, Pacific Crest believes Facebook's more dedicated push into video could drive meaningful engagement that supports incremental revenue in the second half.\n\nPacific Crest expects slight upside to consensus estimates in Q4. The firm expects daily active users to grow 16.5% y/y, which is slightly ahead of the consensus estimate of 14.8% and drives the firm's Q4 ad revenue estimate to $8.47 billion versus the consensus estimate of $8.29 billion. Pacific Crest expects the revenue upside to drive nonGAAP EPS to $1.37, ahead of the consensus estimate of $1.30.\n\nThe firm's price target of $150 is ~30x its 2017 EV/unlevered free cash flow. For 2017, Pacific Crest expects video to play a key part in growth and the ongoing direction of the company as it battles other major players for the TV ad budgets shifting online. Due to FB's early strength in video, massive audience, Instagram and other ancillary opportunities yet to be monetized, the firm sees the stock reaching its $150 price target and remains buyers.", "category": "Facebook 1-27-17", "title": "Pacific Crest on Facebook Inc (FB)"}
