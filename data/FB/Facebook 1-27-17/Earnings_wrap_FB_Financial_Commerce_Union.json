{"body": "Loan growth is still there but execs point to slowing mortgage demand\n\nNewly public bank holding company FB Financial posted a fourth-quarter profit of $9.0 million, down slightly from the number of the same period of 2015.\n\nAdjusted for various items — primarily the company’s change in tax status — pro forma core profits rose 30 percent.\n\nThe downtown-based parent of FirstBank grew net interest income to $29.0 million during the quarter, a year-over-year increase of 15 percent. Fee income climbed to $31.3 million from $24.1 million. The company’s loan book ended the year at $1.85 billion, up 9 percent year over year, while assets were $3.28 billion.\n\n“The fourth quarter showed continued growth in our banking operations with annualized loan and deposit growth of 12.4 percent and 4.8 percent, respectively, while maintaining our net interest margin and our credit quality metrics,” said President and CEO Chris Holmes.\n\nBut Holmes and division president Wib Evans said the increase in mortgage rates late last year put a big dent in FB Financial’s pipeline, adding they are “actively addressing” ways to cut costs.\n\nShares of FB Financial (Ticker: FBK) closed Thursday at $24.99, down slightly on the day. They have risen 14 percent since going public in October.\n\nThe leaders of Commerce Union Bancshares also said their mortgage volumes dropped off in the fourth quarter as they reported profits of $1.4 million, down slightly from the mark of the year-prior quarter.\n\nNet interest income for the period rose slightly to $8.0 million but gains on mortgages sold fell to $642,000 from more than $3 million. Salary and benefit costs also dropped — mainly because the company during the year sold its out-of-state mortgage operations — but not enough to prevent a dip in the bottom line.\n\nLoans ticked up $5 million during the quarter to $658 million, up from $609 million at the end of 2015, and President DeVan Ard said his team expects 2017 loan growth to be in the low double digits.\n\nCommerce Union ended 2016 with assets of $912 million, down slightly from Sept. 30 but up from $876 million a year earlier.\n\nShares of the company (Ticker: CUBN) ticked up to $22.15 Thursday. They are up 12 percent over the past three months.\n\n", "category": "Facebook 1-27-17", "title": "Earnings wrap: FB Financial, Commerce Union"}
