{"body": "As quarterback Russell Wilson's public persona has grown, his willingness to talk about uncomfortable topics in the public eye has grown with him.\n\nOn Tuesday, he moved into the realm of politics during one his many Facebook Live videos on the day. While getting a haircut to prepare for an interview with Doug Gottlieb and other various appearances, he had some harsh words for President Donald Trump and his first week and half in office.\n\n\"Everybody has the right to choose who they want to vote for but this thing is getting out of hand,\" Wilson began. \"It's getting out of hand. I don't care who you voted for. I voted for Hillary but when you think about its only been two weeks or even less than that, we got to attack this issue here. Basically, when you think about all the negativity that's happened within a 10 day period, it's already too much.\n\n\"It's already crazy. It's already affecting people's hearts and souls and lives in such a negative way in my opinion.\"\n\nWilson didn't stop there. He went on to speak out inequality in the world and the multiple protests that have broken out. Check it out below starting at the 9:50 mark of the video.\n\nThe Seahawks, of course, were vocal often during 2016 on police brutality and racial inequality, as they joined San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick's movement spearheaded by wide receiver Doug Baldwin. They provided their own twist on demonstrating during the national anthem without kneeling like Kaepernick.\n\nEven, Wilson was more vocal than normal on the issue, calling for love and a respect for one another to prevail.\n\nIt appears he's only going to increase his voice on important matters in 2017.", "category": "Facebook 2-1-17", "title": "Russell Wilson critical of President Donald Trump on FB live"}
