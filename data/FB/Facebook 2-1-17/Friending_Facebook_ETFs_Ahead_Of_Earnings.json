{"body": "Social media juggernaut Facebook Inc. (FB) reports fourth-quarter earnings after the close of U.S. markets today. Judging by the stock's 2017 performance and recent sell-side analyst commentary on the name, Wall Street is expecting Facebook to easily beat an earnings estimate of $1.31 per share on revenue of $8.51 billion.\n\nNomura recently reiterated a “buy” rating on Facebook with a price target of $155, while RBC Capital Markets reiterated an “outperform” rating on the stock with a $170 price target. Both of those price targets imply significant upside from where Facebook shares currently reside. JPMorgan notes California-based Facebook is its top large-cap pick.\n\nShares of Facebook have climbed more than 13% since the start of 2017, indicating investors are bullish on the social media company's prospects. That could translate to good news for the following exchange traded funds (ETFs).\n\nWith a market cap in the area of $375 billion, Facebook is the seventh-largest U.S. company by market valuation. However, because two of the companies ahead of it are also classified as technology firms, investors need to look beyond traditional tech funds to find the ETFs with truly significant weights to Facebook.\n\nThe Global X Social Media ETF has long been known as a “Facebook ETF.” Mark Zuckerberg's company commands 11.4% of SOCL's weight, making it the largest holding in the ETF's lineup. Putting that in perspective, Facebook is more significant to SOCL than Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) and Yahoo Inc. (YHOO) combined.\n\nSOCL is up about 9% this year, but also resides nearly 9% below its 52-week high, indicating that a bullish report from Facebook could put the social media ETF on the path to more gains.\n\nThe $3.8 billion FDN is the largest dedicated Internet ETF trading in U.S. and tracks the Dow Jones Internet Composite Index. FDN holds 42 stocks, but nearly 21% of its combined weight is allocated to Facebook and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN).\n\nThe ETF's next four holdings would need to be combined to get a figure that rivals the weight FDN assigns to Facebook and Amazon.\n\nFDN has a three-year standard deviation of just over 17%, a sign that this ETF can move when news events dictate as much. Residing just 2% below its all-time high, FDN could reclaim those levels and more with some help from Facebook earnings.\n\nFacebook is the second-largest holding in the PowerShares NASDAQ Internet Portfolio at a weight of 8.2%.\n\nThough this ETF competes with the aforementioned FDN, it has some important differences. Notably, investors will find more ex-US Internet companies, mainly Chinese firms in PNQI and more small caps in the PowerShares ETF than in FDN. PNQI is up nearly 9% this year.", "category": "Facebook 2-1-17", "title": "Friending Facebook ETFs Ahead Of Earnings"}
