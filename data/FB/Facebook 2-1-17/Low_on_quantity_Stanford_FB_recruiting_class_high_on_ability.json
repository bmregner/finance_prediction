{"body": "The latest Stanford football recruiting class is all about quality. The Cardinal not only signed the nation's top quarterback in Davis Mills, it also signed two of the top-rated offensive tackles to protect him in Foster Sarell and Walker Little.\n\nOh yeah, throw in the nation's top tight end in Colby Parkinson and a handful of other 4- and 5-star recruits and no wonder Cardinal coach Davis Shaw is gushing.\n\n\"We were set before we got to today and I'm excited to be able to talk about them,\" Shaw said. \"It felt like a great unit early on, when we brought the group together.\"\n\nStanford received 14 national letters-of-intent and commitments from five others who plan to walk-on, including long snapper Will Sweeney out of St. Ignatius.\n\nTwo others, who signed in 2015, are returning from their LDS church missions.\n\nIn terms of national recruiting services, this is the best class Stanford has ever signed.\n\nLittle, Sarell, Mills, Parkinson and fullback Sione Lund are listed No. 1 at their positions by one service or another.\n\nThere's also the usual assortment of family ties, with center Drew Dalman and tight end Tucker Fisk.\n\nDalman, who prepped at Palma High in Salinas and is a consensus top 10 pick at his position, is the son of former Stanford great Chris Dalman, who also won a Super Bowl with the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nFisk, who prepped at Davis Senior, has former Cardinal and NFL veteran Jason Fisk to partially thank for his football genes.\n\nCornerback Paulsen Adebo, wide receiver Osris St. Brown, running back Connor Wedington, and defensive end Ryan Johnson are also among the top rated athletes at their position.\n\nLittle, Sarell and Davis are Stanford's three highest-ranked recruits in the era of college football recruiting services.\n\n\"And I still think this class is underrated,\" Shaw said. \"The jewel of every class is the quarterback. Quarterback recruiting, for me, is personal. They have to be what we're looking for. He has character, command, the presence to say 'this is what we're running and it's going to work,' the personality and intelligence. After that, it's all ability.\"\n\nMills, like Palo Alto grad and Stanford incumbent quarterback Keller Chryst, is coming off an injury. Chryst should be able to participate in spring football. Mills is expected to travel to Stanford in June.\n\n\"He's accurate, has great feet and a quick release,\" Shaw said of Mills. \"We'll get him here, teach him our way of playing football, which is the west coast, high volume offense.\"\n\nThe Cardinal also have ex-starter Brent Burns and five-star recruit K.J. Costello at quarterback, both of whom will be given a chance during training camp.\n\nSweeney will be joined as preferred walk-ons by defensive end Dylan Boles, linebacker Thunder Keck, tight end Kyle McCombs and safety Joe McGrath. Fullback Houston Heimuli and linebacker Gabe Reid are returning from missions.\n\nShaw called Parkinson \"the best tight end in America. This guy is a mismatch. I'm excited to get him going.\"\n\nAs for playing time, Shaw said \"There's room for guys at tight end and wide receiver. They will be given ample opportunity to come in and contribute.\"\n\nShaw on Adebo: \"He's athletic, has great ball skills, he's fast and explosive. He also played well at wide receiver.\"\n\non Head: \"This guy gets turnovers.:\n\non Johnson: \"He can play anywhere along the defensive line.\"", "category": "Facebook 2-1-17", "title": "Low on quantity, Stanford FB recruiting class high on ability"}
