{"body": "I was getting sick of my own Facebook page. It was time to do something radical.\n\nLet me back up.\n\nI was using my personal FB page to post my opinion pieces, which I write for the gibsonradio.com web location on Foxnews.com. For a while, I felt like a masked provocateur in the night. I’d post some incendiary position (as usual, backed up with links to reportage), then I’d stand back and watch riotous fights break out in the comments section.\n\nConfession is good for the soul: I enjoyed starting fights and watching the pugilists slug it out.\n\nBut then I noticed it wasn’t so much fun anymore. Mostly because the number of minds being changed, or at least softening to someone else’s opinion was hovering at near zero. The old “let’s just agree to disagree” had been scuttled, to be replaced by insults.\n\nFatigue set in. I was tired of it. And I noticed a couple other of my conservative friends felt the same way, so I posted a note on my personal FB page that if you wanted to see my incendiary opinions they are daily posted at gibsonradio.com and on the John Gibson Radio Facebook page. But for the future my personal page was going to be dogs, sunsets, farm life, cool new gear from John Deere, and such.\n\nAbsent from my personal life would be the scorn old friends on the west coast felt they were entitled to heap on me, conveniently sidestepping my reasoned arguments in favor of yet another accusation of being on the wrong side of history, or helping a Nazi nazify America, or being unAmerican. A favorite of the old friends who have calcified in the Liberalism is the “what happened to you?”, or worse, “you’re just mouthing the Fox line for a paycheck.”\n\nI just got to the point of “Basta!”. Enough.\n\nFirst, there were a ton of approving comments from friends, who evidently had been avoiding my page because they were so weary of the toxic debates. They were the happy side.\n\nThen there were the unhappy folks, whose complaint is that the fight must go on, that the Libs and the Dems and the far left are going to go on an anti Trump, and anti Trump supporter jihad and not rest until the uprising of the American people is stomped into a mudhole.\n\nI get it. No shortage of evidence that is precisely their plan.\n\nSo again, I encourage anyone who wants a tough opinion from me on the Left’s crazed reaction to the ascendency of the Trump voter, please just check out my opinion page on gibsonradio.com and the John GibsonRadio page at Facebook. I will be at my post, on duty, and repelling the Hun at the gates and at the parapets.\n\nBut not on my personal FB page. It’s a good place for videos of thunderstorms in the Spring, the pink and blue Texas sunsets, and the zany antics of the many critters that populate the ranch. That stuff is interesting too.\n\nAnd that will have to do for a while.", "category": "Facebook 2-1-17", "title": "WHY I'M STANDING DOWN ON MY PERSONAL FB PAGE"}
