{"body": "FB Financial Corporation (“FB Financial”) (FBK), parent company of FirstBank, reported its results today for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2016.\n\nPresident and CEO Christopher T. Holmes stated, “We reported record revenues, pre-tax income, loans and deposits for the year and benefited from our strong customer service model and our excellent market diversification across Tennessee, Georgia and Alabama. During 2016, we completed one of the most successful bank initial public stock offerings of the year, the largest bank IPO in Tennessee history. We also transformed our operating infrastructure to support growth and future expansion. We are very pleased with contributions from our over 1,100 dedicated associates who make these results possible by serving and caring for our customers.”\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company reported net income of $40.6 million, or $2.10 per diluted common share, compared to $47.9 million, or $2.79 per diluted common share, for 2015. The Company was a Sub-Chapter S-Corporation prior to September 16, 2016, at which time the Company converted to a C-Corporation in conjunction with its initial public offering. On a pro forma C-Corporation tax basis, 2016 net income was $39.4 million, or $2.04 per diluted common share, and $32.9 million, or $1.92 per diluted common share, for 2015.\n\nHolmes continued, “The fourth quarter showed continued growth in our banking operations with annualized loan and deposit growth of 12.4% and 4.8%, respectively, while maintaining our net interest margin and our credit quality metrics. Our strong results for the fourth quarter were partially offset by expected lower mortgage revenue compared with the third quarter of 2016 due to the sharp increase in interest rates and the seasonal slowdown in mortgage activity associated with the fourth quarter. We are actively addressing these challenges in our mortgage operations as the higher interest rate environment persists.”\n\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $9.0 million, or $0.37 per diluted common share, compared to $9.2 million, or $0.53 per diluted common share, for the fourth quarter of 2015, (on a pro forma C-corporation basis, pro forma net income was $5.9 million, or $0.35 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter of 2015).\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company recorded certain significant items which it considers non-core items impacting comparability between periods as follows:\n\nAdjusting net income for pre-tax, non-core net expenses totaling $2.4 million, core net income was $10.5 million, or $0.43 per diluted common share, for the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to pro forma core net income of $8.1 million, or $0.47 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter of 2015.\n\nLoans held for investment at December 31, 2016, rose to $1.85 billion, an increase of $55.4 million, or 12.4% annualized, from September 30, 2016. This compares to an increase of $146.9 million, or 8.6%, from December 31, 2015. Average loans for the fourth quarter of 2016 were $1.81 billion, an increase of $147.7 million, or 8.9%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2015.\n\nTotal deposits increased to $2.67 billion at December 31, 2016, compared to $2.44 billion at December 31, 2015, reflecting an annual growth rate of 9.6% and were up an annualized 4.8% from September 30, 2016. Average deposit balances were $2.67 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of $92.4 million, or 14.3% annualized, from the third quarter of 2016 of $2.58 billion and an increase of $336.9 million, or 14.5%, from the fourth quarter of 2015 balance of $2.33 billion. Average noninterest bearing deposit balances increased to $768.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, from $738.3 million for the third quarter of 2016, and $599.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Cost of total deposits was 0.29% for the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to 0.28% for the fourth quarter of 2015.\n\nLoans held for sale, generated by our mortgage operations, rose to $507.4 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $486.6 million and $273.2 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Average loans held for sale for the fourth quarter of 2016 were $510.2 million compared to $409.7 million and $315.2 million for the third quarter of 2016 and fourth quarter of 2015, respectively.\n\nOur NIM increased to 3.99% for the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to 3.85% for the fourth quarter of 2015. Accretion related to acquired loans contributed 5 basis points to our NIM for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 11 and 3 basis points for the third quarter of 2016 and the fourth quarter of 2015, respectively. Net interest income was $29.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $27.6 million for the third quarter of 2016 and $25.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of 14.8% over the fourth quarter of 2015.\n\n“Our solid growth in loans and deposits reflects our focus on building customer relationships across our markets and the continued growth of our metropolitan markets in Tennessee and Alabama. We remain very positive about our continued growth in 2017,” Holmes said.\n\nInterest Rate Environment Pressures Noninterest Income Compared with the Third Quarter of 2016\n\nNoninterest income rose 30.0% to $31.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $24.1 million for the same period in 2015.\n\nMortgage banking revenues were up 37.0% to $26.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $19.1 million for the same period in 2015. Net gains from mortgage closings and sales increased 27.4% to $22.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $17.6 million for the same period in 2015. Closings rose 126.1% to $1.55 billion in mortgage loans during the quarter compared to $686.3 million in the same period in 2015; however, our mortgage loan interest rate lock commitment pipeline decreased from $850.5 million at September 30, 2016 to $532.9 million at December 31, 2016. As previously discussed, the sharp increase in rates following the November election along with seasonal fluctuation led to a reduction in our mortgage banking revenues from the record levels recorded in the third quarter of 2016. Mortgage servicing revenue was $3.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $1.5 million for the same period in 2015 and $3.7 million for the third quarter of 2016.\n\nWilburn J. (“Wib”) Evans, President of FB Ventures, stated, “For 2016, our mortgage operations delivered record levels of closings and revenues. While our closing levels remained strong, our overall pipeline decreased significantly in the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily in refinance activity due to the sharp increase in mortgage rates. We were able to partially offset this with the increasing growth in our newly established correspondent division. The higher interest rates, lower volumes and change in mix put pressure on margins throughout the quarter. We will continue to evaluate our cost structure as market conditions evolve during 2017.”\n\nNoninterest expense was $47.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $41.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Excluding the non-core items, core noninterest expense was $45.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $38.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. The primary drivers of the increase in noninterest expense was the impact of increased mortgage closing volumes.\n\nOur efficiency ratio, which excludes the non-core items previously discussed, was 73.7% for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 77.2% for the fourth quarter of 2015. Our Banking Segment efficiency ratio was 65.1% for the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to 70.5% for the fourth quarter of 2015, while our Mortgage Segment efficiency ratio was 89.4% and 94.1%, respectively, for the same periods. See “GAAP Reconciliation and Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\n\n“Enhancing our operating leverage is important to our strategy to grow earnings. Our core efficiency ratio improved since last year and benefited, in part, from our conversion to a new core processor in 2016. We believe we have the systems in place to support a larger bank in the future,” commented James R. Gordon, Chief Financial Officer.\n\nAsset quality improved in the latest quarter as nonperforming assets declined to $19.1 million, or 0.58% of total assets, at December 31, 2016, from $24.9 million, or 0.86%, at December 31, 2015.\n\nThe allowance for loan losses equaled 1.18% of loans HFI at December 31, 2016, compared to 1.30% at September 30, 2016, and 1.44% at December 31, 2015. Net charge-offs were $791 thousand, or 0.17% annualized as a percentage of average loans HFI for the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $515 thousand, or 0.12% for the third quarter of 2016, and to 0.14% for the fourth quarter of 2015.\n\nThe provision for loan losses was a reversal of $752 thousand for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to a charge of $71 thousand and a reversal of $2.1 million for the third quarter of 2016 and the fourth quarter of 2015, respectively.\n\n“Our asset quality was strong at year-end 2016,” commented Gordon. “We reported a 13.2% decrease in nonperforming loans, a 36.4% drop in foreclosed real estate, and a 42.4% decrease in trouble debt restructured loans compared with the fourth quarter of last year. Overall, our allowance has decreased from 1.44% at the end of 2015 to 1.18% at the end of 2016 demonstrating the strength of our markets and our continued focus on credit quality.”\n\nThe Company ended the year with a shareholders’ equity to assets ratio and a tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio of 10.09% and 8.65%, respectively, and a book value per common share and tangible book value per common share of $13.71 and $11.58, respectively. This compared to 8.16% and 6.43% and $13.78 and $10.66, respectively, at December 31, 2015. Our common equity tier one ratio improved to 11.05% at December 31, 2016, from 8.23% at December 31, 2015. See “GAAP Reconciliation and Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures”\n\n“FB Financial is positioned well for continued growth in 2017. Our metropolitan markets have proven to be solid contributors to loan and deposit growth in 2016 and our community markets provide a stable base for our operations. We remain focused on our strategy of building shareholder value through organic growth, acquisitions that leverage our operations, and providing best-in-market customer service,” Holmes concluded.\n\nThe live broadcast of FB Financial Corporation’s conference call will begin at 8:00 a.m. CST on Friday, January 27, 2017, and the earnings conference call will be broadcast live over the Internet at http://services.choruscall.com/links/fbk170127ihSlw5zS.html.

These non-GAAP financial measures include, without limitation, net income, diluted earnings per share, total revenues, return on average assets, return on average equity, return on average tangible common equity, noninterest expense and core efficiency ratio, in each case excluding certain income and expense items that the Company’s management considers to be non-core in nature. The Company refers to these non-GAAP measures as core measures. This news release also uses tangible book value per common share and the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio, which are non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of goodwill and other intangibles. The Company’s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in their analysis of the Company’s performance, financial condition and the efficiency of its operations. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide a greater understanding of ongoing operations and enhance comparability of results with prior periods as well as demonstrating the effects of significant non-core gains and charges in the current period. The Company’s management also believes that investors find these non-GAAP financial measures useful as they assist investors in understanding our underlying operating performance and in the analysis of ongoing operating trends. In addition, because intangible assets such as goodwill and other intangibles, and the other items excluded each vary extensively from company to company, the Company believes that the presentation of this information allows investors to more easily compare the Company’s results to the results of other companies. However, the non-GAAP financial measures discussed herein should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable or other financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which we calculate the non-GAAP financial measures discussed herein may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names. You should understand how such other banking organizations calculate their financial measures similar or with names similar to the non-GAAP financial measures we have discussed herein when comparing such non-GAAP financial measures.
