{"body": "Chase Lasater may have seemed like a strong bet to join the Auburn recruiting class, but that ship appears to have sailed on Thursday.\n\nLasater called Auburn his “main school” after an official visit to The Plains last weekend, but apparently he had a recent change of heart based on the change from Rhett Lashlee to Chip Lindsey at offensive coordinator.\n\nOn Thursday, Lasaster posted a letter to Twitter explaining that he would not be committing to Auburn and inviting other schools to jump into the fray.\n\nAfter his visit with the Tigers, Lasaster told SEC Country’s Benjamin Wolk that he enjoyed the opportunity to meet with Lindsey and learn more about how the H-back will be utilized going forward in the Auburn offense: “I was just wondering what type of scheme he’s going to run. He said spread and power, and I like the power with the H-back.”\n\nBut something must have happened between now and then that changed the Jacksonville, Fla. native’s mind on whether he would have a role with the Tigers or not.\n\nLasater, who is rated as the nation’s No. 5 fullback in the 247Sports composite rankings for the Class of 2017, has an 83% 247Sports Crystal Ball projection to land at Florida Atlantic. Former Alabama offensive coordinator is the new head coach for the Owls.", "category": "Facebook 1-26-17", "title": "Coveted FB recruit Chase Lasater turns down Auburn with letter, could choose Lane Kiffin instead"}
