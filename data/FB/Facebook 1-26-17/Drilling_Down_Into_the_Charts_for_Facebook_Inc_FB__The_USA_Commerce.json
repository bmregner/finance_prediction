{"body": "We have gathered the technical data on Facebook, Inc. (FB), and see some interesting trends in the stock’s behavior of late. In the end, it’s all about what a stock does that matters. In the case of this particular stock, the chart tells quite a story at present.\n\nFB has been trading in a bearish trend, based on the relative levels of its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages. This suggests that the broad sum of capital flow in the stock has been generally negative over the recent period. In terms of the relative level of interest afforded this stock among active participants in the market, relative volume measures have been weak, indicating apathy for the name by traders, investors, and money managers during the past month of action. This suggests something of the significance of other current technical measures as well.\n\nFor market timers, it’s also important to take measure of the relative level of recent lift or pressure in the stock is it overbought or oversold? For that, we turn to RSI and stochastic measures. The 14-day RSI stands at 74.58%. That shows that the stock, according to a traditional interpretation and usage of the RSI indicator, is becoming overbought or overvalued, and therefore may be primed for a trend reversal or corrective pullback in price If we look at the stochastic measure, the raw data over the stock’s last month of action shows a score of 97.54%. Based on a raw data interpretation, the stock is relatively overbought from this perspective.\n\nIt should be noted that the overall volatility in the stock is worth gauging as well. In recent action, FB has made a move of +14.21 over the past month. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 14.44%, and it’s gotten there by action that has been less volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. The stock’s recent movement has come on a historical volatility score of 15.47%, which represents the standard deviation of returns of a theoretical long position from a mean price during that period. On a daily basis over the past month, the average true range of the stock, as expressed in percentage terms, is 1.7%. That should give you a pretty good sense of the level of risk implied in a short-term trading approach in the stock with a stop-loss in place.\n\nAs it stands at present, the stock might find important action at key Fibonacci levels. Fibonacci levels are used by major Wall Street firm technical desks. The math is drawn from the Fibonacci series that defines growth systems by an interval increase characterized by steps divisible by the “golden ratio” of 61.8%. In this case, the critical 38.2% level drawn off the 52-weeklow of $94.23 sits at $109.23. FB also has additional support below at the stock’s 200-day simple moving average, which sits at $121.39.", "category": "Facebook 1-26-17", "title": "Drilling Down Into the Charts for Facebook, Inc.
