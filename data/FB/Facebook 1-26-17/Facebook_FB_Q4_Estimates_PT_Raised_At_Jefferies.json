{"body": "Analyst Brian Fitzgerald is boosting his expectations for Q4 from $0.96 to $1.05. He also is raising FY 2016 EPS from $2.87 to $3.08 and FY 2017 from $3.53 to $4.12.\n\nHe comments \"For 4Q, we model mobile ad revenue of $7.09B vs. Street $7.12B. We remain particularly optimistic around Instagram, which continues to look like a picture-perfect ad platform to us. Now open to all advertisers, Instagram monetization should ramp quickly. During 3Q, Instagram added a new Stories feature designed to compete with other players in the space. The company recently announced that they will begin rolling out advertisements on Instagram Stories to take advantage of the 150MM users that engage with Stories daily (roughly half on Instagram’s total daily user base). FB generated $12 in ARPU across its global user base in 2015 – we would expect Instagram to monetize at lower levels for now across its user base. We look for FB to continue efforts to monetize its mobile ad business and take advantage of record user levels for Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.\"\n\nFitzgerald also says that video will again come to the forefront and tells clients they ought to expect positive commentary relating to Facebook Live.\n\nFor an analyst ratings summary and ratings history on Facebook click here.
