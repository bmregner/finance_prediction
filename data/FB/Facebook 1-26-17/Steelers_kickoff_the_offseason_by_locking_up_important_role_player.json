{"body": "The Pittsburgh Steelers are off and running in the 2017 offseason. They reportedly made a move Thursday that will make star running back Le’Veon Bell very happy.\n\nThe Steelers will re-sign fullback Roosevelt Nix to a one-year deal worth $615,000, his agent told PennLive.com’s Jacob Klinger.\n\nNix originally joined the Steelers on a futures contract in Jan. 2015 and has since become an important role player within their high-powered offense. The undrafted free agent out of Kent State switched from linebacker to fullback upon joining the Steelers. He’s played in 25 games and has rushed for only 21 yards during that span, but his value extends beyond his stats.\n\nNix has helped pave the way for Bell the past two seasons. Of course, the Steelers will have to make sure Bell stays in town this offseason, as his contract expires this offseason.", "category": "Facebook 1-26-17", "title": "Steelers kickoff the offseason by locking up important role player"}
