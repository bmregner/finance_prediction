{"body": "Jefferies is raising its estimates given its expectation Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) remains the primary beneficiary as ad dollars pour into mobile ad campaigns on a global basis. For 4Q, Jefferies model revenue / GAAP EPS of $8.54B / $1.05 vs. Street $8.50B / $1.04. Jefferies estimates imply 46% Y/Y growth in revenue with 36% net margin.\n\nFor 4Q, Jefferies model mobile ad revenue of $7.09B vs. Street $7.12B. Jefferies remain particularly optimistic around Instagram, which continues to look like a picture-perfect ad platform to us. Now open to all advertisers, Instagram monetization should ramp quickly. During 3Q, Instagram added a new Stories feature designed to compete with other players in the space. The company recently announced that they will begin rolling out advertisements on Instagram Stories to take advantage of the 150MM users that engage with Stories daily (roughly half on Instagram's total daily user base). Facebook generated $12 in ARPU across its global user base in 2015 â€“ Jefferies would expect Instagram to monetize at lower levels for now across its user base. Jefferies looks for Facebook to continue efforts to monetize its mobile ad business and take advantage of record user levels for Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.\n\nZuckerberg says we are at the beginning of the golden age of online video. Users can now broadcast videos directly through Facebook's Live video service. Since May, the number of people broadcasting live video on Facebook has increased by 4x. Live videos also see 10x more comments vs. regular videos, and TV stars are generating larger audiences on Live vs. their TV shows. This is important as Facebook attempts to increase the amount of original content shared across its platform.\n\nIn September, Facebook apologized for an error in the way it measured video viewership that overstated how much time users were watching videos. Facebook had been excluding videos watched for fewer than three seconds from average viewing times. While the issue garnered a lot of press, Jefferies thinks marketers will mostly overlook the issue. This quote from TechCrunch sums up Jefferies beliefs: \"The issue is being hugely overblown. Marketers do not care about it, and it has zero impact on spend,\" says Jason Stein, the founder and CEO of a 250-employee marketing agency Laundry Service.\n\nFacebook has grown its ad business by around $1.6B in the past two quarters. This equates to Facebook growing almost two Yelpsized businesses (~$900MM rev '16e) or about half a Twitter ($3B rev '16e) in the past two quarters alone. In absolute dollar figures, Facebook is growing its ad business faster than larger peer Alphabet, which added $1.4B of new ad revenue during the same time period. This suggests Facebook is the primary beneficiary as new ad dollars pour into mobile ad campaigns.", "category": "Facebook", "title": "Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB): ad dollars pour into mobile ad campaigns on a global basis"}
