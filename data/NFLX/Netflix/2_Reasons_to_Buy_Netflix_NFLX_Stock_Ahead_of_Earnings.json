{"body": "Netflix (NFLX) is set to report its fourth quarter fiscal 2016 earnings results after the closing bell on Wednesday. Making a bet on Netflix stock, which has risen 32% in three months, requires not only the belief that the company can maintain its subscriber growth, but also Netflix will soon cash in on the investments it has made to expand internationally.\n\nIndeed, Netflix stock — hovering new all-time highs — is not a screaming bargain at current levels. In fact, Wall Street's consensus price target of $130 assumes potential declines of around 3%. Add in the fact Netflix shares tend to trade erratically following its earnings report, one would need to have a strong conviction in CEO Reed Hasting’s vision. To that end, here are two reasons to support why Netflix shares will continue to outperform in 2017.\n\nIn the third quarter, Netflix — by adding 370,000 new subscribers domestically and 3.2 million internationally — easily cruised by Wall Street’s subscriber forecasts. Notably, the company’s price increase for grandfathered subscribers, a popular-cited bearish concern, didn’t impact Netflix’s subscribers totals to the extent some analysts feared. Not to mention, Netflix’s Q3 churn rate of the 2.6% beat consensus estimates, which ranged from 3% to 5%.\n\nNetflix said the strong results were “driven primarily by stronger than expected acquisition due to excitement around Netflix original content.” And while, the company’s self-produced shows such as \"Stranger Things\" require more upfront cash to complete, cash — thanks to the price increase, combined with higher subscribers won’t be a problem. And the fact that Netflix plans to increase its hours of original programming to 1,000 in 2017, from 600 in 2016 suggests the management sees no signs of slowing down.\n\nCan a movie-streaming service have a better partner than Disney (DIS)? Be prepared to make a good argument. Thanks to Disney’s partnership, which became effective in September, Netflix had exclusive streaming rights not only to Disney films, but also Marvel, Pixar and Lucasfilm. This means effective in September, Netflix subscribers had access to Disney blockbusters such as Captain America: Civil War, Zootopia, and The Jungle Book.\n\nDisney’s movie studios, which in 2016 surpassed $3 billion in at the U.S. box office (an industry record) will be a huge catalyst for Netflix. What's more the fact that Netflix will be able to stream upcoming movies in the Star Wars franchise and new Pixar features such as Finding Dory, these titles should help offset the competition Netflix faces from Hulu and Amazon (AMZN) Prime. And with Disney exceeding the $7.6 billion in global box office sales, Netflix’s international subscriber will get a boost too.", "category": "Netflix", "title": "2 Reasons to Buy Netflix (NFLX) Stock Ahead of Earnings"}
