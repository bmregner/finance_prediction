{"body": "President Donald Trump today appointed Ajit Pai, an FCC commissioner who is opposed to net neutrality, to head the Federal Communications Commission. Pai, who was one of two Republican commissioners in the agency’s five-member panel, has been a fierce critic of net neutrality, a principle that telecom providers should allow equal bandwidth access to established companies and startups alike. In a statement posted to the FCC website, Pai said he was “deeply grateful” and looked forward to bringing “the benefits of the digital age to all Americans.”\n\nPai’s appointment to head an agency responsible for policing America’s telecom carriers in a digital age is in keeping with the Trump administration’s appointments, so far. The forty-four-year-old Pai criticized his predecessor Tom Wheeler’s attempts to change the regulatory structure for telecom providers. For example, he said that net neutrality is “a solution that won’t work to a problem that doesn’t exist” in an interview with Reason TV. (For more, see also: What You Should Know About Net Neutrality.)\n\nPai has already served notice about his intentions. In a speech last December, he said that the Trump administration would “fire up the weed whacker and remove those rules that are holding back investment, innovation and job creation.” In all probability, net neutrality regulations will undergo significant changes or be axed completely.\n\nNetflix Inc. (NFLX), the largest video service on the Internet today, will not be affected by those changes. In the past, the Los Gatos-based company has locked horns with telecom behemoths, such as AT&T Inc. (T) and Comcast Inc. (CMCSA), charging them with intentionally “throttling” its connection speed to consumers. Those charges affected the FCC’s decisions relating to net neutrality. (For more, see also: Netflix Will Not Oppose AT&T And Time Warner Merger.)\n\nIn its latest letter to stockholders, Netflix seems to have had a change of heart. “Weakening of U.S. net neutrality laws, should that occur, is unlikely to materially affect our domestic margins or service quality because we are now popular enough with consumers to keep our relationships with ISPs stable,” the company said.\n\nIn his interview on Reason TV, Pai said that building out the nuts and bolts of the internet was a pretty tough thing and that if the “regulatory system second-guesses you every step of the way, regulates the rates etc ... then, you are going to have the European situation.” In effect, Pai does not like regulations and will work to dismantle them.\n\nIronically, enough, though, this could also translate into good news for mergers and acquisitions between telecom companies. He has opposed mergers in the past but only on technical grounds and not because he feared that they would result in monopolies. As Billboard magazine points out, Pai approved of AT&T’s acquisition of DirecTV and was quoted as saying that a Republican administration would have approved Comcast’s proposed acquisition of Time Warner Cable.", "category": "Netflix", "title": "Trump Appoints Net Neutrality Critic as FCC Head"}
