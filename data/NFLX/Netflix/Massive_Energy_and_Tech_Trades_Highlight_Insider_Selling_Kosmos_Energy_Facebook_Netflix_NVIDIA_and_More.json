{"body": "After a historic trading week, which ended on Friday with the inauguration of Donald Trump, investors are ready to focus on the rest of the month, earnings and the prospects for 2017. One thing is for sure, while the volume of insider trading has slowed due to fourth-quarter earnings being reported, we continued to see some big sales in technology.\n\nWe cover insider selling every week at 24/7 Wall St., and we like to remind readers that just because an individual or 10% institutional owner sells stock, that is no cause for immediate alarm.

(NYSE: KOS) had some huge sellers on the desk this week. Warburg Pincus sold a total of 38,902,874 shares at $6.65 apiece. The total for the sales was an incredible $325,204,112.
