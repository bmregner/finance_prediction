{"body": "Some analysts have long proffered that streaming-content guru Netflix (NFLX), which reports Q4 earnings after the bell Wednesday, has been instrumental in shifting television viewing habits for U.S., and now international, consumers. Who among us, for example, knew what binge-watching was five years ago? Now it seems to be a part of everyday life, and, according to some analysts, a core element of NFLX’s strategy to increase viewership numbers.\n\nAt a time when NFLX is raising prices and facing stronger competition for consumer viewing-screen time from the likes of Amazon (AMZN) and even Apple (AAPL), investors may want to take notice of those numbers. Did NFLX attract the 1.45 million new U.S. and the 3.75 million global subscribers that it forecast for Q4? What has been the impact of fresh shows like The Crown and popular standbys like House of Cards? Thursday’s results may bolster the company’s self-described claim as “the world’s leading Internet television network with over 86 million members in over 190 countries enjoying more than 125 million hours of TV shows and movies per day.”\n\nSome analysts say they will be listening for more information on NFLX’s plans for 2017, which represents the fifth year of its original content strategy. In Q3, NFLX said in a note to shareholders that it was planning to release more than 1,000 hours of original programming. That’s more than a 66% jump from the 600 hours that were on tap for 2016. Part of the increase may come from unscripted shows like The Ultimate Beastmaster, a bodybuilding competition series that names Sylvester Stallone as its executive producer. Some analysts will be listening for clues as to how NFLX plans to promote the series, which will be released simultaneously around the world in six languages. Some may want to know how this plays into their global strategy.\n\nNFLX also indicated in Q3 that it was planning to up its content budget by $1 billion to $6 billion this year. Are those numbers still on track? Last quarter, NFLX generated a negative $506 million in free cash flow, part of its continued strategy to invest up front for content and intellectual property. In last quarter’s note it called such investments “a wise investment that creates long term value. Consequently, we plan on investing more, which will continue to weigh on free cash flow.”\n\nBesides, the company finished Q3 with $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents, according to the note.\n\nFor the quarter, analysts are forecasting, on average, earnings of $0.13 per share, up 30% from last year’s $0.10 a share, according to FactSet. Revenue is expected to come in at $2.47 billion, a 35% increase over the previous year.\n\nShort-term options traders have priced in a potential share price move of 8.5% in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move™ indicator on the thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade.\n\nThere have been call buyers at the weekly 135-strike, with put activity seen at the 130 strike. The implied volatility sits in the upper half at the 51st percentile. (Please remember past performance is no guarantee of future results.)\n\nNote: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. Put options represent the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time.\n\n", "category": "Netflix 1-27-17", "title": "Binge-watching Earnings?
