{"body": "MKM Partners updated its estimates for Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) following another very strong quarter and outlook. MKM’s outlook for domestic is relatively unchanged, with higher subs and positive contribution from international. While there are questions about potential changes in net neutrality policy, the primary debate now centers on whether the stock is fully valued.\n\nMKM does not think so. MKM sees over $12 per share of earnings power potential by 2021, think the company will still be in rapid growth mode for subscribers, and EPS and should trade at 20-25x forward EPS (i.e. $270 per share) by 2020. MKM raised its 12- month price target to $175 from $165, discounting the midpoint of its 2020 valuation by 25% per year.\n\nThe content is proving to travel worldwide. This is no longer Hollywood produced content traveling to international markets, but regional content is increasingly reaching a worldwide audience on Netflix. The company is seeing strength across geographies, notes that original programming is becoming a significant subscriber acquisition draw, especially in newer regions and is still early on the S-curve in most of its international footprint. This dynamic is expected to improve as the budget grows and management called out even better traction by 2H.\n\nMKM forecasts international to ramp to 115mn subscribers in the next five years. This implies 22% penetration of broadband homes (28% developed economies/ 14% developing). The earlier international cohorts are already above this level about five years after launch. MKM estimate Wave-1 developed economies are already approaching 30% penetration (in aggregate) and that Latin America is already above 14% penetration of broadband homes. On a total household basis, MKM forecast reflects 12% penetration in regions excluding China in five years time. Pay-TV penetration was about 55% of international households (excluding China) at end-2015.MKM thinks that over the coming decades, the Internet will drive penetration of subscription video deeper than pay-TV systems. MKM’s view is shaped partially because OTT is better, but mostly by price elasticity as it is a lot cheaper to deploy.\n\nWhile the ramp in content spending is not expected to moderate anytime soon, the model can absorb higher costs and expand margin so long as subscribers (and moderate price increases) continue to grow. MKM +$12 EPS outlook for 2021 embeds a content budget of over $11Bn that year, from the $6Bn planned for 2017. MKM expects blended contribution margin of 40-41%, below where domestic will be this quarter. MKM sees more than 25% EPS growth into 2022 with a content budget that exceeds $12Bn for that year. MKM thinks the company will still have ample subscriber and APRU opportunities at that time.", "category": "Netflix 1-30-17", "title": "Netflix, Inc.
