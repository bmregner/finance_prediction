{"body": "Netflix, Inc. NFLX is set to report fourth-quarter 2016 results on Jan 18. In the last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 100.00%.\n\nThe company has delivered positive earnings surprises in the last four quarters with an average beat of 200.00%.\n\nLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.\n\nNetflix has been drawing strength from its growing portfolio of original content. This apart, it remains focused on international expansion as it battles slowing domestic subscriber growth to solidify presence in markets like India and Korea.\n\nIn order to gain more subscribers in Korea, Netflix has announced a 12 episode original series named Love Alarm. It is based on “webtoon” by a famous Korean author Kye Young Chon. Netflix also collaborated with Indian movies’ superstar Shahrukh Khan’s production house, Red Chillies Entertainment. Per agreement, all the movies of the superstar will be available on Netflix for global viewing.\n\nApart from this, the company is also forming strategic partnerships with the likes of TiVo Corp TIVO and others to boost its content further. Moreover, Netflix has been strategically placing itself to meet the needs of the new-age binge-watchers.\n\nHowever, investors need to watch out for high costs that will accompany rapid international expansion and production of original content. These aside, stiffening competition from bellwethers like Amazon.com AMZN, Hulu and Time Warner’s HBO is a concern.\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2016, management forecasts earnings of 13 cents per share and net income of $56 million. Domestic and international streaming revenues are expected to be $1.4 billion and $947 million, respectively. Total streaming revenues are expected to be $2.34 billion. Management expects to add 1.45 million subscribers in the domestic streaming segment compared with 3.75 million subscribers in the international segment in the fourth quarter.\n\nDomestic streaming contribution profit is expected to be $515 million. International streaming loss is expected to be $75 million due to higher marketing spend. Netflix estimates U.S. contribution margin to be around 36.9% in the quarter. Netflix forecasts operating income of $125 million for the quarter.\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively show that Netflix is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.\n\nZacks ESP:  Netflix’s Earnings ESP is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 13 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nZacks Rank: Netflix has a Zacks Rank #3. Though Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.\n\nMeanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.\n\nNetflix, Inc.
