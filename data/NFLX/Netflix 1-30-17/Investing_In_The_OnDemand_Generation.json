{"body": "The media landscape today is changing at a blistering pace, despite what many investors or analyst seem to think. This rapid pace of change is so profound that unless you experience it, you could hardly believe it was true.\n\nFor my family, it all changed about two years ago. My eldest daughter was going on five, and my youngest was just a year old. Cutting-edge tech guy that I am, I felt left out not having access to Netflix (NFLX) or any other streaming media services. I subscribed to what seemed like an endless number of cable channels but still couldn't find a show I wanted to watch. I wasn't impressed with the smart TV technology available at the time. Then I discovered Roku, and it changed my home entertainment universe in a way I would never have expected.\n\nI hardwired Roku players to my internet connection, a blazing fast 75 Mbps Verizon (VZ) Fios hookup, connected top-of-the-line HDMI cables, and I was in business. At first, the sheer number of services was overwhelming. I went for the basics: Netflix and Amazon Prime (AMZN). The latter was an easy choice, since we were already Prime users. I was in business, until my daughter took over.\n\nRoku was so easy to use a four-year-old could dominate it. We started finding all the Nickelodeon Channels, Disney content, and the like. Conventional TV was off the table, we watched Roku exclusively. When we had visitors, my eldest would ask about Roku and they just assumed we had gotten a cat. I would explain she meant the remote control. Then one day my daughter wanted to watch Peppa Pig, and we had a problem. Peppa Pig wasn't available on any of the apps we had, but then we found it on YouTube. Overnight, YouTube became the go-to source for my daughter's entertainment. Now, my two girls watch nearly 95% of their content on Roku. The media world they are growing up in is fundamentally different than the one the older generations experienced: they know names like Netflix and YouTube the same way I knew CBS, ABC, and NBC when I was their age.\n\nWith streaming media, there are no commercials; there are, at worst, five-second skippable ads. Don't like an episode? Switch to another one instantly. Love an episode? Watch it over and over again until you have it memorized. Find a part funny? Go back and watch it again. The best part about streaming media? It's portable.\n\nThe generation of kids growing up from 2010 onwards are what I call the \"On-Demand Generation.\" They are not only creating their own new habits, their habits are influencing the viewing habits of their parents as well. They are creating YouTube stars, individuals producing big shows on small budgets and getting million of subscribers. Those subscribers are giving their shows hundreds of million of views. With ads screening before the content, videos monetize and creators are making money.\n\nIn my analysis, the On-Demand Generation is changing the media landscape in a way that is likely comparable to television replacing radio. Cable still has a place in this brave new world, because to access a show on Nick Jr. or Disney Jr., you still need to log on through your local cable provider, via a username or password. However, this role as gatekeeper will not last forever.\n\nThe On-Demand Generation is an eminently investable theme. There will be winners and loser in all of this. First the winners:\n\nIt all starts with data, and that means companies like Verizon and AT&T (T) are big winners, providing data both at home and on mobile. Verizon had the lead here for quite some time, with Fios. However, AT&T with its acquisition of DirectTV and Time Warner pending seems to be overtaking its rival. Not only will AT&T provide the data connection and the delivery, but it will also have the content to go with it. (See also: AT&T to Buy Time Warner for $85.4 Billion.)\n\nCompanies like Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet (GOOGL) are next, for two reasons. First, they control the cloud and data storage for content and are the content distribution providers. Companies such as Akamai (AKAM) are also players in the content delivery space, but the presence of an Amazon or Alphabet is so great, I fear for Akamai in this arena. Of course, companies like AMZN, NFLX, and GOOGL also have the content, after all, Alphabet owns YouTube.\n\nThe other winners are the content providers, Walt Disney (DIS) and Time Warner (TWX). However, it starts getting tricky here, because not all content providers are equal. The small standalone content providers could struggle.\n\nNFLX has about 40 million domestic subscribers. A real YouTube Star could have 2 million subscribers, or more. Think about it: a YouTube star with an iPhone and some basic video programs has 5% of the total subscribers NFLX has today. However, NFLX should have around a $6 billion content budget in 2017. These YouTube stars will spell trouble for smaller standalone content providers. For example, CBS All-Access has only 1.2 million subscribers, which means one generic YouTube star could have more on-line subscribers than CBS. Plus the content providers are spending billions of dollars to produce content when a YouTube star can produce a 30 min show for very little money and their own free time. There are only 24 hours in a day, and people only have so much viewing time. (See also: CBS Stock Pops Higher On Potential Hulu Deal.)\n\nThe smaller standalone companies like CBS, AMC Networks (AMCX), and Discovery (DISCA) could struggle with these numbers. They have large budgets, they need to pay top dollar for talent, and are now not only competing with other content providers but also with YouTube. In my house, the kids are watching things like YouTube and Netflix from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. every night. There is an entire generation growing up with no familiarity with ABC, CBS, or NBC. Luckily for ABC, they are owned by Disney and ever child knows Disney. Comcast (CMCSA) owns NBC, and people use Comcast for currently for cable and data as well.\n\nComcast along with other cable providers will have a hard time acquiring new cable subscribers. When the On-Demand kids get older, they will not be like the Millennials, and they will not use both cable and streaming services. The On-Demand generation will most likely only use streaming services and will be able to function and get all of their content without a cable provider. True, they will still need the data feed, potentially, but 5G will likely do away with that as well. When Comcast agreed to put Netflix on their set-top boxes, I thought it was a game changer, more so for Netflix, as it symbolized the acknowledgment by Comcast that they need NFLX to help slow the migration away from cable. (See also: Why Netflix, Comcast Went From Enemies to Friends.)\n\nIn my view, these phenomena will drive a massive amount of consolidation in the space. We have already begun to see this play out with the AT&T/TWX merger. If the merger is approved, AT&T will control the entire pipeline: content, data transfer, and subscribers. Verizon has already moved on the mobile front by acquiring AOL and Yahoo. However, I think they need to do more to follow AT&T. Smaller, stand-alone companies will need to do more, too, which is why I'm surprised CBS and Viacom (VIAB) did not do a merger. The cable providers will also have to look at merging for scale, and will likely be forced to buy content as well. The days of watching cable the way we always have are probably coming to an end in the not-too-distant future. (See also: A CBS-Viacom Merger Would Pursue Synergies.)\n\nThe On-Demand Generation is very young, but if they haven't been introduced to a content provider like CBS or ABC in a few years, the business models of the latter will be in trouble. After all, you can't miss something if you never knew it existed.\n\nMichael Kramer and the Clients of Mott Capital Management, LLC own shares of NFLX,VZ, and DIS.
