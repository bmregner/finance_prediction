The reboot will bring back behind-the-scenes talent — co-creators David Collins and Michael Williams — but will recast the gay “Fab Five” who grant makeovers to straight men. The show will see the stylists leave New York City to travel to middle America.\n\n“In a time when America stands divided and the future seems uncertain, a team of five brave men will try to bring us closer together with laughter, heart, and just the right amount of moisturizer,” the producers said in a statement. “With a new Fab 5 and the show’s toughest missions to date, Queer Eye moves from the Big Apple to turn the red states pink … one makeover at a time.”\n\nThe original series was a huge hit on Bravo in 2003, skyrocketing stars Carson Kressley, Ted Allen, Jai Rodriguez, Thom Filicia and Kyan Douglas to instant fame. The series won an Emmy for Outstanding Reality Program in 2004 and lasted 100 episodes until it went off the air in 2007. (Source: bizjournals.com)\n\nNetflix, Inc.
