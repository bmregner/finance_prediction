{"body": "It seems Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is actively looking to diversify its business model and revenue streams as it slowly acknowledges the reality that iPhone sales and popularity are losing steam around the world. According to a latest report, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is getting ready to jump into the content business, with intentions to start producing its own original series and movies. These plans are a direct threat to companies like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon and Spotify.\n\nWith the start of 2017, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced its plans to produce 16 episodes of Carpool Karaoke, which will be hosted by famous stars and celebrities like Alicia Keys, John Legend, Chelsea Handler, Blake Shelton, Ariana Grande and Family Guy’s Seth MacFarlane. In July 2016, Apple reportedly started working on its first ever reality show, Planet of the Apps. Apple is also working on a six-episode series named “Vital Signs” which will feature Dr. Dre.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) planned original programming products will be available for the subscribers of Apple Music, which has struggled to complete with Spotify, which has 40 million paid subscribers.  For years, Apple has tried to penetrate the media and content industry. It even tried to start its own live-TV service, but ultimately dumped the plan in December 2015 amid fierce resistance by media giants.\n\nNetflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) will be the top competitor of Apple in the television show business. The company has 86.7 million total subscribers, out of which 39.3 million are outside the US. On the other hand, Amazon’s streaming service has 21.7 million domestic subscribers, but it does not have market penetration and its shows aren’t popular enough. Experts think that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) survived the onslaught by Amazon in the content business, and it will beat Apple too. Its famous original series like House of Cards, Stranger Things, Narcos and Orange is the New Black have become household names around the world. Netflix still has about 4.3 million subscribers to its DVD rental services.\n\nThe company has come up with a new plan to serve this customer base.  In the third quarter, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) added 3.2 million new international subscribers, and 370,000 domestic subscribers, while the Street was expecting 304,000 new domestic subscribers and 2 million international subscribers. The main reason behind these low projections were the lackluster growth posted by the company in the second quarter of 2016. But Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) surprised the investors and as a result, its stock soared to new highs. The stock is up over 23% year-to-date.\n\nAdvanced Real-Time Chart: If not automatically loaded with the correct symbol related to this article, you can manually enter it (ex.
