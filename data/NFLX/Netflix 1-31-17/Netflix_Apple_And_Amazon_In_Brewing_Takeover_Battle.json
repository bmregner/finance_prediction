{"body": "Welcome to the Meaty issue of M&A Daily\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have joined Liberty Global (NASDAQ:LBTYA) as potential suitors for ITV (OTCPK:ITVPY). 2017 looks like a strong year for media content consolidation; an ITV deal could be just the beginning.\n\nBob Evans (NASDAQ:BOBE) is paying their shareholders a $7.50 special dividend and selling their restaurants to Golden Gate. Bob Evans is working with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM); UBS (NYSE:UBS) is working with Golden Gate.\n\nThanks to fellow owner Tom Sandell for encouraging this outcome.\n\nCisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) is buying AppDynamics for $3.7 billion. The target is working with Goldman (NYSE:GS) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) on the deal.\n\nTextron (NYSE:TXT) is buying Arctic Cat (NASDAQ:ACAT) in a $241 million cash deal. ACAT holders get $18.50 per share.\n\nIt is good to be Evan Spiegel. He is the world's youngest billionaire. His company, Snapchat (Private:CHAT) is going public, but he's issuing shares with no voting rights so that he will get new capital while maintaining total control. Everyone has hardships, but things are starting to look up for Miranda Kerr's boyfriend.\n\nThe HSR review of the Takeda (OTCPK:TKPYY) and ARIAD (NASDAQ:ARIA) deal expires February 8. The $0.25 arb spread offers a 14% IRR if the deal closes next month.\n\nAbbott (NYSE:ABT) secured EU approval for its Alere (NYSE:ALR) deal. That review has been the least of their worries. The arb spread is $16.49.\n\nThe definitive proxy has been filed for the China Oceanwide (OTC:HHRBF) acquisition of Genworth (NYSE:GNW). Genworth shareholders vote March 7. On one hand, the $1.85 arb spread offers an 86% IRR if the deal closes by September. On the other hand, Genworth has a massive downside if the deal breaks. This is why it is called \"risk\" arbitrage.\n\nThe first S-4 amendment has been filed for the Community Bank (NYSE:CBU) acquisition of Merchants (NASDAQ:MBVT).\n\nThe S-4 has been declared effective for the MACOM (NASDAQ:MTSI) acquisition of Applied Micro (NASDAQ:AMCC). The exchange offer expires later today.\n\nIsle of Capri (NASDAQ:ISLE) and Eldorado (NASDAQ:ERI) shareholders votes today on their deal.\n\nThe definitive merger agreement was filed for the WestRock (NYSE:WRK) acquisition of Multi Packaging (NYSE:MPSX).\n\nThe DOJ, Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security asked the FCC to delay action on the CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) acquisition of Level 3 (NASDAQ:LVLT) until the completion of the departments' security review.\n\nWalgreens (NASDAQ:WBA) and Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) do not plan on terminating their merger agreement on their Friday walk date. The arb spread is $2.04 and the deal will probably close this quarter. More to come in future editions of M&A Dailyâ€¦\n\nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
