{"body": "We’ve got great news for all Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) fans; the online streaming giant is reportedly testing a new feature which will allow its users to control the app with their brains. The move seems to be a part of the company’s strategy to position itself as a dominant force in the online streaming industry.\n\nSubsequently, as a part of its \"Hack Day\" event, the online streaming giant had asked its product team to experiment with new innovative technologies to propagate new features on its platform. One of the most innovative ideas that were revealed last week was MindFlix, which allow users to navigate and control the app with their mind.\n\nMany experts believe that if the online streaming giant manages to introduce this feature on its platform, it will certainly witness significant surge in its user base. Adding to that, the company is planning to use a Muse headband that identifies EEG (Electroencephalography) waves and enable users to move their heads to scroll around the user interface of the app. Also, users can just think of the word \"Play\" in order to start the video.\n\nThe recent moves made by the online streaming giant indicate that it’s pretty serious about achieving its market ventures in the online streaming industry. The company recently rolled out its new \"offline-mode\" feature, which allows users to download the content from its platform in order to watch offline.\n\nIt seems that Netflix is putting much effort to think out of the box in a bid to offer top-notch and innovative features to its users. Many analysts believe that these kinds of moves are necessary for Netflix to retain its position in the online streaming industry.\n\nThe company did not offer any time frame about its new much-hype feature, MindFlix. However, the news has ignited excitement among the users and many seem to be waiting desperately to use it. In any case, we’ll keep a track on company’s moves in order to keep our readers up to date.", "category": "Netflix 1-31-17", "title": "Netflix, Inc.
