## How to use these notebooks
----
Dear reader,
This folder contains several jupyter notebooks that were used in the early stages of development of our code 
and are still actively used to manually test features and engineer new ones.

They are also very useful to showcase what our code can do and how to use it.

We are still working on their contents but they will become nice walkthroughs for our project.

Enjoy!
