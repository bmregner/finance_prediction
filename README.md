## Road map
---
- [x] Obtain data
- [x] Try to predict using simple models
- [x] Increase automation and modularity
- [x] Use clean coding standards
- [ ] Implement unit tests
- [ ] Visualize results on a webpage
- [ ] Make model dynamic (real-time updates)

## Future work
---
- Bring in other data sources
- Try other models
- Try to predict different indicators/quantities
