# Finance Prediction [status = "in development"]
----
This project aims to build of an automated, general purpose, and real-time pipeline to predict financial indicators using machine learning on several news sources.

## Contributors
---
Lead: Ben Regner 
Team: Andrea Massari, Daisy Zheng, Saina Lajevardi

## Usage
---
A thorough walkthrough can be found in the notebooks/ directory.

An automated script, "try_me_script.py", can be run from command line from this home directory with 
```
python3 try_me_script.py
```
N.B. several requirements are needed, we will improve the portability of this code in the near future

## Road map
---
- [x] Obtain data
- [x] Try to predict using simple models
- [x] Increase automation and modularity
- [x] Use clean coding standards
- [ ] Implement unit tests
- [ ] Visualize results on a webpage
- [ ] Make model dynamic (real-time updates)

## Future work
---
- Bring in other data sources
- Try other models
- Try to predict different indicators/quantities
